89:Demario Bolden,Better than Tinder
106:Bill Holmes,Literally as bad as Tinder. I don't understand how these companies think monetizing every little aspect of their app is going to have a good impact on their reputation. In response to the reply. You people literally took free features and put them behind a paywall. You might be able to justify your greed in your mind. But we see right through it. You don't deserve 1 star but we're not allowed to give less.
"201:Urvi Shah,""My suggestion to you would be to remove the friends & bizz section. In the name of bizz, your app is misleading people. On one hand you promise to help network with business-minded people, but on the other-hand I'm not allowed to put-up my business handle in my bio ? What kind of hypocrites are developing this app ? Could your """"BIZZ"""" section be more fake ? Tinder's far better, atleast they don't mislead people with pointless features like yours."""
202:harsh jethani,If you are not going to show me the profiles of my matches I am gonna download Tinder
"229:Dylan Jeter,""I didn't think it was even possible to make a dating app worse than Tinder... But you guys managed to do it. I deleted it... For one, the app is FAR too money hungry and hides every single feature behind a paywall. They advertise the app as the dating app that's made to be deleted, but I feel they need to reevaluate that line. I got more likes on my first day or two on the app, then the app started trying to encourage me to pay for premium. Upon declining, I've pretty much quit getting likes."""
"242:Magasinet Sundhed,""Very disappointed that spotlight did not work and then the app even says after having spent all this money on spotlight, that it was a success! I do like on Tinder that spotlight at least allows to continue swiping or that I can see in the corner the hearts with profiles that saw me. This Bumble spotlight is just money out off the window, absolutely no sign that I received anything for my money"""
"333:Mitchell,""It takes 24 hours for likes to reset, there's no timer, and you only get 10 free swipes. Absolutely useless app. This used to be so much better than Tinder a few years ago and then they removed all the free features and it's terrible now."""
"569:Tristin Barnes,""Sadly to say, I've also downloaded this app as well as Tinder, we need better dating apps, and there's gotta be a way to keep these bots off the dating apps, maybe put up a fire wall for bots people who are not real, also you need to do something about these high subscriptions you guys are making us pay, something must be done asap, you guys say your the #1 dating app, so then show us that you are what you say you are."""
"619:Jakub Luptak,""Limiting organic matches as much as Tinder (ie not showing you the people that liked you as priority, used to in the past!), but the general idea of women communicating first is nice and empowering"""
632:Shardul Singh,Way better than Tinder tbh. Although problem of bots still exists
837:Bart Van Eeuwen,Better than Tinder so far!
"921:Mike Salmon,""I prefer this app over Tinder because women have to post a clear picture of their face. I always report the profiles that wear a mask or its not a clear photo. Otherwise, this app becomes like Tinder, and you get women that only have pictures of cats, food, or places they traveled to. I don't know why Tinder has allowed itself to become trash. Anyways, as soon as Bumble allows users to post only masked pictures, I'm out."""
"975:Fredrik Hallin,""Tinder copy with few users, yet they think they can charge almost as much for the slightest chance to stand out. If you want to charge guys 80$ for a membership when we can't write, we're not gonna use your app."""
1131:Chris Williamson,It's better than Tinder on pricing. You can get a one day or one week pass also... (MAJOR WIN). What I also like is if women are genuinely interested they will make the first move & unlike Tinder there isn't a ton of scam profiles that I've seen. I give 4 stars and not 5 bc of having to wait 24 hours to be able to swipe again once you run out of likes. Change that and it is the best dating app.
"1223:B B,""I've had a better experience on Craigslist before they took away Casual Encounters. Why did I even try this app? Just because I'm banned from Tinder, which is just as bad as Bumble. Don't bother replying to this review Bumble. We all hate you."""
1264:Mr Robot,Why can't you show how much time is remaining untill we can start swiping again?? Also reduce the wait time to 12 hrs atleast. Tinder is way better in these things.
"1272:Steven,""I like that the pressure is taken off of guys to make the first move. The dating market allows for women to generally be more selective about matches, so it's nice to have a system that guarantees that a match is going to actually be interested. I think the interface is much more thorough than Tinder, with the ability to look at full photos and have more in-depth bio information. I also think the prompts provided for potential matches is a great icebreaking feature."""
"1322:It's a Me,""This app has continued to take away basic functions and hide them behind an ever increasing paywall. You can't see your likes, okay fine, $14 a month. Also, you won't be seen unless you're spotlighted, but now it's $19 a month and that give you a few days. Oh, you ran out of likes, by the way the fee is now $30 a month and you still have limited amount of """"likes"""" but you can always buy more. This was once a decent non-threatening way to meet people, it's clearly become only a cash cow. You're better off with OKC or Tinder again now, even with their history of bots. (bumble has them too)"""
1363:Nemanja Vuletic,Nice app. Here you actually get to match ( unlike Tinder).
1435:Kameron Diaz,When this app first came out it was similar to tinder. Could talk and chat and do a lot for free but now it's a pay wall. Wish it would go back to the way it was. I used it a lot more than Tinder too back then
1444:Andreas Meyer,Better than Tinder
1470:Tribhav Sharda,Tinder is better After Reading all the comments I am really scared to buy anything from this app
1628:Abhay Gupta,Tinder is better
"1753:Erwin Rossen,""It's identical to Tinder. There is an endless supply of profiles, most of them without any information about themselves, and you have to swipe them left or right based on hardly anything. After sweeping a couple of thousand profiles, you might have a match."""
"1765:Jag Samra,""This app is alarming sexist against men & women dont know how to conversate. UPDATE: App is still trash and biased against men, you're telling me girls can post their asses and cleavage all over their profile but I put up one shirtless pic and get moderated? Lmao this app is worse than Tinder and that's really sad"""
1795:Brendan Williams,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME! Terrible app. Tinder and Hinge provide WAY more matches. No wonder Bumble stock is a dumpster fire.
1835:Ibr Shivaz,this app is a Tinder rip-off. have fewer candidates. the configurations are a bit difficult. the SuperLike button should be moved to another part of the screen because people keep pressing SuperLike by mistake while swiping.
"1872:Mustafizur Sarkar,""I had a bad day and came to read the 1 🌟 ratings from frustrated Singles of India. 🤣🤣🤣 Bumble, just ignore the 1 star ratings like Tinder."""
1887:James Hoagland,It's Tinder but worst
1924:Roll Boy,A pale shadow of Tinder (wich is also not so great with hes algorithm) with absurd rules even for payed users consider rethinking your approach to dating if you are taking people's time and money
"2140:Hello Bryan,""CALL YOUR BANK/CREDIT CARD. ASK THEM TO """"DISPUTE"""" YOUR CHARGE. Update: Your business was blantantly stolen from Tinder, its premise inherently does not function, and your stock sucks. I don't use your app - I'm just enlightening all the users your company has ripped off."""
"2142:David Carrega,""Tinder for adults seeking actual relationships. Edit: Expired matches disappear in your inbox after a week, even if you're premium. I travel for work, and I am often unable to check Bumble for weeks at a time. I question whether premium is worth it at this point. I used to rematch with expired connections. Now I can't."""
2262:Jakk Arson,Fake profiles created by Bumble to get you to use your limit of 5 likes a day. A scam to get you to pay for a membership. Bumble was good before they got greedy and becoming more like Tinder. You see Tinder makes a change then Bumble follows. You want to be the better dating app? Be the better person too.
2291:Harlee,I have the same acount on Tinder and Bumble and Tinder gets me like twenty times the amount of matches. Bumble is also the most greedy app I've ever seen. They want you to pay for every little thing. They can suck it.
"2301:Nathan D,""Hi Bumble! It would be great to filter for people by pronoun/orientation. Also, having some larger travel mode regions to swipe in would be excellent, sort of like Tinder's global swipe option. For instance, I think the EU should be a swipeable region. You've formed a large consumer base of people who left Tinder due to overly strict bans -- capitalize on Tinder's mistakes and introduce more detailed filters to help serious customers. More tools, not more strictness/bans that hurt buyers. 🤗"""
"2309:Alexander Keefe,""I didn't think it was possible to dislike the experience of using a dating app more than Tinder and yet here we are 1. It won't save edits I make to my profile, and crops photos that I didn't want to be cropped 2. it won't let you choose your own photos. It repeatedly popped up an error saying I needed to choose a clear photo of myself. It was a clear photo of my face so their image detection doesn't work"""
2382:vkjain007,Pathetic dating app i have ever seen ..No match till now from last 2 months and not had a single match ..And i had 10++ matches in Tinder dating app in last 1 month and on happn app 12 matches in one match .. Seriously 👎 a big zero (0) to the founder and the software developer and not having the swipeable right is active everyday ..
"2420:Roujin,""Pointless. Women don't want to make the first move (as stated on multiple women's profiles where they are asking for people to hit them up), and it still requires that both parties match first. So it's like Tinder if there was an extra wall before you can chat with someone."""
2466:Sheila May Macaroncio,My ex I met in bumble cheated on me with a cheap girl on Tinder.
"2557:CameraSet Action,""Not a single match . I've been using bumble for years and I have 300+ matches on Tinder, however I cannot get a single match on bumble. Which sucks because I find the girls to be much better on this app."""
"2592:Jordan Pease,""This app went from being better than Tinder to being purely a cash grab. WAY less likes than you used to get, constant barrage of ads to get premium, they literally removed a feature that was free and make it premium only (being able to reswipe on someone you just swiped on), and many more. Do not bother."""
2606:Jay Thakkar,Thousand Times Better than Tinder
2653:Jaerrod/Foster Halstead,App is good. Just like Tinder but different at the same time.
"2680:Sidionian,""Bumble is pathetic Feminist, sexist garbage. Bans exist just for being reported. And you can get reported for anything, even if no proof exists or it's just he-said she-said. If you delete a match, that person can report you just out of spite for deleting them. Absolutely disgusting, politically correct, gynocentric rubbish. Bumbe and Tinder should learn from other dating apps, where reporting someone needs to be accompanied by EVIDENCE! (Screenshots or Conversation archive etc.)"""
2692:Ross Pound,The concept of women go first is a great plan. But unfortunately I haven't found the one on here nor Tinder and anyone else I have a suspicion that girls on here just love to use the matchmaking as a doll collection and some accounts on here are fake or a mock up otherwise I would of given a perfect 5 if that was fixed
2705:Varun Awasthi,Nice app but only only problem males can't start chatting like Tinder.
2759:Isacc Sushi,Alright app. It is pretty smooth and easy to use sure but its too similar to Tinders issue with a a extremely low chance of getting a match if your a male. I think after 1 year I had 2 matchs in total and just started swiping yes to everything.
"2775:Olivia Lane,""Bumble sucks so much. Never any matches, and if I get one they never respond.. low quality of people on here. Tinder is surprisingly better."""
"2801:Tushar Rathod,""Tinder wins even after buying premium of bumble i got no match i realised its waste of money & time, thought it could be more better but just waste."""
"2829:Blessing Ankra,""Stupid app, gets worsen every year. 1 Star wouldn't have being an option for me, a better ranting would have being 0 star if there was an option for that. How can bumble just logout someone without non of their rules violated? just for reaching limited likes for the day the next day bumble get you logout rubbish! Tinder is still far better than this app."""
"2862:Vladimirs Kacs,""So much better than Tinder or Badoo, despite the smaller user base."""
"2908:Rachit Chaudhary,""I would say that Bumble is still better than Tinder. Intention focused dating app, a UI with a tad bit less focus on photos in comparison to Tinder and a bit wholesome bios. Overall what all the dating apps lack in general is interaction between users. Let them get a taste of the person they like and charge them once they're hooked. Who's going to pay for uncertainty? Or you can hire me as product manager, I can help."""
2972:Aman Gupta,Tinder give 5 super like every month for free and 1 spotlight every month. Why don't you make your app too be good as tinder.
"2985:ernestsolos,""I purchased 5 superlikes for 299 rupees. OTP came for the eame but it deducted 1300 rupees. Tried contacting bumble, they didn't even respond. Tinder is way better. I have 40 likes without buying any premium service. Here I have just 1 after spending 1300 rupees. I'm actually going to consumer forum now. This app needs to be closed now!!"""
3031:Kyle Sullivan,Terrible and basically same app as Tinder with same horrid paywall to use basic functions like messaging or liking others. I understand why people still use apps like Grindr etc.
3103:Martand Pratap Singh,Do not subscribe. Tinder is much better . If you forget to cancel the subscription they will take the money and won't even give you back after request. Highly unprofessional
"3160:Eshan Ghose,""Bumble is GOOD. Much better than Tinder, in my opinion. And their customer service is top notch. I had a problem, so I contacted Bumble Support on Twitter. Not only did they respond promptly but they also understood my problem and fixed it within a few hours. Would definitely recommend!"""
"3199:Keaton Ullah,""Can't login because my numbers been blocked. It's a new phone and I was not blocked, and I say yall should use Tinder only because you can login everywhere. These other dating apps don't know how to use email for login. If someone gets blocked an someone takes there number, the number remains blocked. Tinder is the only one that hasn't done that to me because they use email for login and not number."""
3221:Mazi Nazi,It's a 100 times better than Tinder
3370:Panda N,This app is actually bad. I got almost 30 likes after creating my profile but i got no even 1 match after swipe right all profile. They want to push you buy premium to get match LOL. And premium is more expensive than Tinder even this is worse.
3414:Arif Bhuiyan,I think it's more usefull then Tinder.
"3440:Israel Rangel,""This app used to be good for me, but now it's just a whole bunch of girls way out of my league so it feels like they're all fake profiles! I haven't had a match in ages on Bumble whereas I've had tons of CMB and even Tinder. What a waste"""
"3474:Vijwal Akula,""Although I have a tough time getting matches, I would say this app is well designed, works well enough. I like the question prompts they have too. Overall, better than Tinder in every way except number of users. Otherwise perfect."""
3610:Mr Anonymous,The major dissatisfaction I have with this app is that I can't restrict my search to only include people within a preferred distance radius just as Tinder does it. I keep seeing profiles of people who are far away in distance than I prefer.
3644:Douglas March,Tinder (ugh) has now blown past what used to be my favorite dating app. Now time to try something else. Bye forever.
"3663:Lena Valenzuela,""DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP. I gave it 3 chances and not one dates. You waste time swiping and when you find a guy you like and you swipe right He is gone you never see him unless he is a match and there is no icon to message guys weather you match with them or not. I message them a lot about the time messages and nothing. They have 24 hours to contact you or poof they go away. They run a horrible algorithm Sometimes I get women in my matches nothing against Woman, but I am not into women. Also did the $30 a month tried it for 5 months nothing. The hives is the same thing. They only want money. All they tell you is fix your profile and nothing is wrong with my profile You are better off taking your chances with Match or Tinder at least you can message someone you like on there. They say woman make the move is a lie its not different then Tinder at least Tinder and other apps have a message button My advise avoid this dating app like you would the Covid 19. Trust me you will be single for a long time using this app. I had to give it 1 star because it would not let me give them no stars, but they deserve NO STARS."""
"3748:Gabriel Avornicu,""Started out great, being more fun than Tinder and stuff, but after a while the app gets useless. Also great idea to let girls/women take the first step, but there is a time limit on it, which means both parties should be using the app pretty much every single day. That neutralised about five matches for me. The other two just didn't work out and after a while no matches appeared. // Good intentions of the creators, but in the and just a normal premium subscription-based app."""
"3761:Crested Saguaro,""Bumble is pretty good, but there's this dumb feature prevent you from adding """"mirror selfies"""" to your profile. So far, all the people I've seen on the app are legit. I haven't run into scammers, bots or fake profiles using this app like when I used Tinder."""
3803:Mick o,bumble finally sold out... might as well call it Tinder 😅..
3840:Jacob McCalpin,I used it a few years ago and loved it. Now it's changed a lot and you spend almost no time on the app unless you pay. Totally garbg Edit: thanks devs for responding. I think it would be more beneficial for your users to allow more time for engagement in the app. Tinder has a limit on the amount of likes you can use which allows the user to spend more time in the app. The influx of one star reviews for Bumble would indicate to me that users are not happy with the amount of time spent in Bumbl
"3847:Ryan,""Figured after a few months I would update my review. Bumble suffers from the same things Tinder does; too many scam accounts, no way of seeing when the person you're viewing was even last on, and constant adds despite the app still barely holding a connection. Edit: 2/22/2022. Not a single person have ever swiped on me the entire plus year I've used it. Not one. Yes thats depressing.Rates have gone up, as fast as the scammers accounts have. I'm done with this app."""
"3867:Pritam Chavan,""I have no clue how this app finds you a match. Not a single match single last 3 years. I mean I don't understand who does the algorithm favors. Also tried the subscription for month, but unfortunately same results. Pathetic service. Tinder works far better than this. Please y'all should genuinely check your algorithm issues."""
3922:Symon Jefferson,Its been better than Tinder!
"3931:Commander WB,""I tried just about every dating app, and Bumble has been among the worst experiences I've had with online dating. I had very few matches on the app and can say with confidence it is a fault of Bumble and not my profile as an identical profile on Tinder and other apps had more successful matches. The 24 hour limit rarely has the desired impact of forcing communication, but often the opposite by guaranteeing a failure of communication. Also, very few profiles are available to see per day for free"""
"3996:Tiffany Henry,""Bumble is the safest platform for women to find love online. I seen a screenshot of the Bumble team emailing a victim of sexual assault after deleting the perpetrator's account. It was warm, kind, and they seem to genuinely care about our safety unlike Tinder and other dating applications. It was one of the many times I've witnessed them go above and beyond for people using the app to show appreciation or just to be good folks. Thank you for setting an example, Bumble! <3"""
4007:Vivek Venga,It's good if you're a minority living in Malaysia. Much less Malay hijab womens here compared Tinder. No offense to them.
4060:Isaac Darkstar,2 matches that haven't responded in the first week! This site is faster than Tinder!!!! 🤣😂 Edit: Still not a single match has connected with me.
"4081:Damian Snell,""Pure hypergamy 😄 The same fun nightmare that dating is on the other similar apps, like OKC & Tinder. Have met 2 people through Bumble in 2 months. I like that women must message first so that I don't waste my time crafting a clever opener for someone who isn't all that interested or just has a better option. The same lack of a sense of humour seems to pervade the community as it does with all the other dating apps *admins barred IP for reason """"we received complaints about this profile"""""""
"4087:Georg Plaz,""I really thought bumble honestly wanted to be the better date maker than tinder. The filters really worked to find your kind of people. I was enthusiastic about bumble, I even sometimes paid for stuff. But seeing how the features thaz made this app great are moved behind the pay-wall. It seems like bumble is just a greedy company after all. It makes Bumble just as useless as Tinder if you don't follow the pay-to-win model."""
"4097:Keith,""I actually like the concept of Bumble, it really weeds out the women that are playing games and seeking attention. Less matches than Tinder, but better quality. I've met a few awesome girls on here so far and I'm not paying anything 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️. 4 to 2 starts.... I find it very annoying that woman can post half nude thong bikini pics, yet when I post a non-selfie non-bathroom shirt less pic it gets moderated. Also, every profile is woman advertising there social media, snap IG... So annoying."""
4140:Nick M,The same owners to Tinder. It is a trash app that you shouldn't put time and money into
"4202:0. .0,""I want to give four stars. I could even give five. But I have some gripes. The premise is kind of amazing for its simple innovation. Putting the onus on women not only gives them a sense of security, it gives men marginally more assurance they're not throwing their time away. But it's a little frustrating to be presented with people based on present location rather than area of residence. Undermines the pros stated above (hookups are for Tinder). And Instagram integration is rekt."""
"4276:Armin,""The experience is terrible. If you're not paying for the subscription, your profile gets exposure only to people that you may see in your stack of swipes. Once you get suckered into paying for the subscription to see the """"10 likes"""" you've received, your profile stops getting exposure and than you don't receive anymore likes. This has happened to me countless times and I honestly think Bumble is running an humanless algorithm that racks in big $$$ on desperate human beings. Same goes for Tinder."""
4281:Nicholas Desaulniers,Good idea bad execution. 24 to 48 hours is not enough time for people to respond. I've had multiple swipes that all lead to nothing. No response. Even if I boosted by 24 hours. Are they bots? I don't know. I currently have one like and I swipe each day to get no like back. With okcupid and Tinder you an usually get a match quickly.
"4317:Cameron Ray,""Do not waste your time, effort, and money. They are like Tinder, they require you to pay to talk to your matches. This app is bad and is unreliable in many areas. They give you really good deals, at least that's what it looks like but when you click it it requires 30-90 dollars. This app is a huge scam. Do not trust the 5 start ratings, look at the 2-3 star, those are your real ratings. I will post this again incase this app tries to delete my post again for the fifth time."""
4323:Jean Luis Urena,Like 20 swipes and you're done for the day 😂. I'll stick to Tinder.
4459:Oga Boga,Very poor moderation. Your account will get blocked and removed for ignoring messages. Full of weirdos. no better than Tinder minutes the poor customer service
4472:Jeffrey Valiente,The problem with this app is the paywall. Tinder and other dating apps wont force you to pay. This is fine as a tandem app for any dating apps. Just dont rely too much. It will constantly remind you how lackluster the free usage of this app.
4488:ImABee,Tinder 2 electric boogaloo
"4526:Jakeb Lindsay,""Will permaban you for no reason. I've never met anyone in person on this app. I've never initiated sexual conversations. I don't send dirty pics. I'm guessing the last conversation i had with a woman on there, I told her I didn't want a relationship because my woman had passed away in 2020 and explained I wasn't ready. Everything I've read, if a woman reports you for ANYTHING you're banned for life. Stick with Tinder. You're better off."""
"4529:Will Berry,""Seems Bumble has massively decreased the amount of likes you can get. That added to the removal of the 3 free undos, it's clear that they're trying to push you to pay for premium features. Used to be a much better alternative to Tinder, now it's just as bad. Avoid."""
4553:Edwin Devilas,I like bumble. Some of the people are as fickle like on Tinder. But still could use improvement. They could offer more incentives
4591:Angel Attocknie,Tinder sucks but this is even worse with the servers and people on it too plus the amount of money it cost just for a month is horrid
"4707:AJ CB,""It's a fun idea and decently put together, I don't feel like I have any trouble matching, my problem is the timer. Why on Earth would you put a direct limiting factor on your ability to match, and then worse, paywall the extensions? Obviously its for money, but what sense does it make for busy people to have to check the app every day just to make sure they don't miss a bite? For that reason it's a worse alternative to Tinder. Don't spend your money here, I doubt it'll help you."""
4743:Pintu Singh,The worst app to use. Can any of the developer or bumble team explain why there is a 24 hour window to send a message? I can understand why woman first but why 24 hours? I have missed so many matches due to this and when I met the same girls from Aisle/Tinder they told me they were not aware of it also mostly they stop notification during weekdays so they don't see any matches as they remain busy
"4832:Chris Saxon,""This app sucks! Do not download. I've been on it once and uninstalling. The matching is pathetic, They chargefor everything including filters for matches, viewing likes that you may not even like, messaging. Stick with Tinder, Clover Chat, or Badoo. They're so much better."""
4917:Oriana Morgan,Tedious with none of the benefit promised. Not any better than Tinder.
4945:selvam swamykannu,Just been using for a week. So far I like Bumble. Definitely better than Tinder. Will update the review after few months of use
"5014:Stanislav Marchevsky,""Much better experience than Badoo or Tinder. Love, when women write first :)"""
"5184:M Duran,""The reality is every dating site has gone down hill. All apps have pay walls. The only thing that you should be looking for is which ones you can talk on for free. Bumble, POF, and Tinder are the only ones. This app is more Male friendly. Only women can send the first msg. And they only have 24 hours or poof, opportunity gone. Does away with the """"I will not msg 1st"""" bs on other apps. So only non stuck up girls are on this one. I haven't paid and I'm talking with 2 right now so..."""
"5194:Benjamin Moorman,""Tinder with the gimmick that only women can initiate contact. Somewhat useful in the past, but they've now locked vital filters (namely religion) behind a steeper paywall than I've seen in almost any other dating app. I struggle to understand why any man would bother. EDIT: The daily subscription remains a poor value, especially given the paucity of matches I'm actually interested in following removal of advanced filter options. I obviously could scroll through each match, tediously rejecting each one that a basic filter would have previously prevented me from wasting my time looking at, slowly crushing my will to keep wading through the soul-sucking,depressing slough of the swipe left/right model you use. But the field of online dating is a crowded one. I'd rather spend my time (and money) on apps and services which aren't decreasing their usefulness in a transparent attempt to drive up subs. Bumble was deleted the day I made my intial review."""
"5317:TheodoreFocus,""Got moderated and no justifiable reason given. It wasn't my photos or they'd have been removed. It wasn't the content of my profile or it'd have been edited. It wasn't anything I said to my matches or they'd have just unmatched. Account deleted, poor review given. Perhaps Bumble need to review their policies. It's saying something when it has a poorer rating than Tinder."""
"5346:Chad Englot,""Finally a site that is definitely worse than POF and Tinder. I actually didn't think it was possible! I guess that'll explain why so few women and matches in a city of 300,000. Bumble, you are a joke!"""
"5362:Aseem Sameer,""This app is worse than tinder. You don't get relevant people either, but within just 15-20 swipes, it says you're done for the day. Tinder lets us swipe atleast 30-35 people. Disappointed and ofc, already stopped wasting my time with this dreadful app."""
"5371:Michael Avery Rollins,""Had the account for several weeks, never got 1 like. Came across the same people on Tinder and immediately matched with them. Not only that, you're slowly but surely having to pay for everything. I don't recommend this app at all."""
5458:Eashan Deshmukh,Better than Tinder!
"5554:William Elliott,""Use Hinge instead. Bumble is owned by Tinder. And they're both horribly buggy. My friend worked for them for a few weeks and confirmed nobody knows what they're doing. Hence all the negative reviews. (How many popular apps do you see with this many bad reviews??) Luckily more and more people are switching to decent apps. I rarely hear people say """"Tinder"""" or """"Bumble"""" anymore. 5 years ago that's what people said when talking about dating apps. Now you hear """"Hinge"""" most of the time in the real worl"""
5565:Jody Homewood,Better than Tinder as less fake accounts
"5627:A Google user,""Bumble the only app asking us to update, without providing any update details. You want me to email and ask for info that you should provide for everyone up front? Now your latest update make the app just like Tinder. Abd Don't think we have forgotten your promise of free backtracks for life. Now you have reneged on changing a swipe error and expect us to pay$ not cool!"""
"5728:Mike Perks,""JUST A COMPLETE RIP OFF FOR MEN! In short, you'll appear high in women's searches for the first day or so then your profile will disappear in the abyss; unless you perpetually pay for spotlights and superswipes it's pretty much useless and begs the question what do premium membership fee actually provide? I've compared this side by side with Tinder using the sames pics & bio, truly shocking differences. If you want to flutter money away for a glimpse of attention, go to a strip club."""
5772:David Lowe,Like the app but would be better if you could scroll the photos the same way Tinder does it.
"5880:lobo-loco812,""It's kinda devolved into another Tinder clone which sucks, still a slightly better experience but honestly I wouldn't recommend it to anyone"""
5945:CJ Chabot,No better than Tinder
6012:Kunal Parwani,I feel like Tinder is better
"6024:trevor hayes,""Terrible app, the free feature only allows you 10 swipes then you need to wait until the next day, you get notifications about matches and then when you go into the site nothing is there. Needs alot of improvement, just seams like a scam to me to force people to pay for subscriptions and then you can't cancell. Better of sticking with Tinder."""
"6044:Daniel Lewis,""I can see a lot of negativity but it's a dating app at the end of they day, it's always gonna be hit and miss, but compared to Tinder which I've used a fair but, Bumble is a clear winner."""
"6061:C AMA,""Worst app ever, together with Badoo and Tinder. They can all hold hands and jump into the deep."""
"6211:Cody G,""Deleted for two reasons: 1) I don't like companies that give money to a group like Black Lives Matter and stuff like that. 2) I put in a ton of time on this app, and 90% or more of the profiles (I'm convinced by this) are either fake or that the women on this app aren't quality partners for long-term dating. Will never use this app again. This is Tinder with a different name and setup. Don't waste your time, y'all. Bumble sucks."""
"6226:R.J. Cagampan,""Free features removed in favor of subscriptions. I used to be able to filter one or two tags, but now it's a premium feature. I work on the road, so these apps aren't a bad way to meet people, but I habitually have to watch distance as it seems to like queuing up people 75 miles away or in another state entirely. Somewhat confused userbase wants to use IG or Snap 90% of the time or forgets that women make the initial contact in the app. Tinder is just as bad, but has a better feature set."""
6261:Marlita Nimmocks,This website does not allow freedom of speech. It is also extremely rampant in child sex trafficking. There are men on here who are looking for pictures of women with their children in them. Please beware of what pictures you put up. I believe that bumble is in on this as well as these other websites like Tinder and plenty of fish. They're all one group. Most definitely in on something sinister. I've seen too much crazy activity. These sites need to be shut down permanently.
6280:Sam,Tinder seems to be much simpler and more accessible.
6293:Christopher Mills,Bumble needs to hide any accounts that have been inactive for over two weeks. It's a waist of everyone's time and effort. I have been on it for over a year and nothing has resulted in a date. I have zero problems getting dates in person. ZERO. Dating apps are a tool and this one has become dull. Tinder yields better results for all types of relationships but fakes are about 80% Eharmony is empty. The league is 80% fake or inactive. Facebook dating is 95% fake. Never really tried Match. 36M
"6310:Kim Womack,""Used to be one of the best dating apps, until they started hiding everything behind the great great paywall, like Tinder does. Shame on you! - Thanks for your generic reply. Consider hiring skilled devs instead of marketing people.. For real."""
"6328:Elle Bradley,""I was a big fan of Bumble until recently. I'm genderfluid & study the occult. I'd always limit the amounts of Christians/conservatives profiles I see because they have a tendency to hate crime me. Bumble took the feature to limit profiles away. It's now a premium feature. I shouldn't have to pay for a service that limits/decreases the transphobia I experience. I won't be on a dating app where I don't have options to make me safe. Bumble is becoming the new Tinder, and that's scary. Do better."""
"6356:A Google user,""Interesting premise of women writing first. Doesn't work in reality (99% just write """"hey"""" or send some random gif) but it's at least better than Tinder. UPDATE Jan2022: wow, tried app for first time in a couple years and they have really ruined it. So much moved behind paywall that the """"free"""" use isn't even worth free. Clearly making all the same mistakes as Tinder. Moved to Hinge, no regrets."""
"6398:Taran Vazquez,""Moderated to hell, can't edit your swipe preferences. But people on average put more into their profiles than on Tinder."""
6534:Saksham Meena,Better than Tinder
6589:Princess Bomongcag,Not that good as Tinder
"6645:GRaTePHuLDoL,""Major cash grab now, they used to actually give you a decent amount of likes, now it's like 10 every 24 hours, even less then Tinder"""
"6683:IndigoAurora,""I would have given the review more stars if it wasn't for the fact they removed the search feature for the free version of the app. The appeal of Bumble over Tinder is you can search what kind of relationship people want. They also have been gradually decreasing the amount of right swipes you get in a 24 hour period. I understand if you want people to pay for the full version of the app, but these kinds of practices will only make people use the app less and drive potential buyers away."""
"6687:Jontae Hall,""This app is a waste of time. I thought about trying it since Tinder was no better in finding people to have a conversation, but at least over there I found some people. I have tried this app for a week with no luck. Plus making it so that the women initiate the conversation is stupid when there is a timer for them to respond to get a chat going, but half of them don't even want to talk first. Don't waste money or time here."""
"6722:Chris _,""They need to do more to catch up to Tinder. Limit on likes is really low. And if there's a limit for females, that's quite surprising. I would prefer unlimited likes for females and a decent limit for males. Even if you pay, they will never have enough likes to see you ever. I would prefer Ads over limits."""
"6845:Yash Rao,""Worst Experience so far, I installed the app 3 weeks ago and after going through couple of profiles I realized its just another version of Tinder .We were doing a Short Documentary film on online dating and I wantedbto gather as much as information possible and for that I had to subscribe for premium membership and that was the wprst mistake. I canceled the membership within first week of subscription and now its been 3 weeks and am getting charged every week. Stay away its a scam."""
"6858:Fanamos Gaming,""This is the worst dating app for getting matches. ALL the other dating apps are much better at actually showing you the people who liked you. This app is trash. *Edit* Where do I mention paying to match? Seriously, this is the worst dating app, I don't recommend downloading it. Tinder, Hinge, Badoo and even Happen are all better dating apps than Bumble."""
"6903:Scott Baines,""Good app. Way better than Tinder. Suggestion for any bumble developers who may read this. Allow us to sort recent conversations we've responded to on top. Sometimes I get a flood of matches I'm not interested in, and I have to scroll down a lot to find the ones I want to talk to. Would be nice if I could send those to the bottom, while I continue talking to the ones I want to."""
"6991:Wilbur,""While it's better than Tinder, some of the features are terrible, like 5 SuperSwipes should be made available daily for lifetime subscribers instead of weekly. Secondly, your profile still doesn't get seen by others because the same profiles are shown again every few days even if you swiped right."""
"7026:Luke Dornbush,""It was tough when you could pick one or two filters like """"nonsmoker"""" or religious preference. You now have to subscribe to use any filter at all. If I want to wade through people with all my deal breakers, I can use Tinder for that"""
7236:A Google user,Women take the lead in selecting who they want to talk to. Guys have to like and don't need opening lines (profiles are short). I found this better than Okcupid and Tinder. Has video chat.
"7256:Mrigesh Parmar,""Completely useless dating app. You better off using Tinder and getting an actual person. Figured I would try it and got the 6 month sub. To my regret, a good majority of people I saw were people I had previously seen. Bumble states they don't have any bots which is definitely false. I should have stuck with BBB's rating of their company which is a big fat """"F"""". This app just gets you to pay money for no actual results. """"IF"""" and a big fat one at that, you managed to get an connection and make a relationship out of that you a lucky one."""
7296:Noor Ashique,The worst app to invest in if you want to make friends/ date online. They will loot you with money and you will get no results. Women have to actually text you first to start a conversation 🤣 Like seriously. This is the dumbest decision on the planet especially when we all know that women rarely make the first move. Never ever waste your money here guys. This app is biased and will give you zero results. Tinder will always remain the king of online dating!
"7320:Familiar Stranger,""To Bumble's credit, I have matched and talked to a few women on there app using a free account. My main issue with Bumble is the people they are showing me. They all have identical personalities with different faces. A little too nerdy for me and I've been in different states. Tinder actualy shows me a variety of personalities. Thats why I delete the app. They are all dog moms, into bars & wine and they talk about their degrees. BORING!"""
7349:Robert L.,Had a few dates and girlfriends from this app. Left Tinder for it! The timed messages showed me who was genuinely interested and helped a lot!
7354:T McD,Better than Tinder. Less fish pics.
"7372:Beshoy Saad,""People who like you never show up in your feed, so that you are forced to pay to see them. I have been running out of swipes everyday and never have I seen any of my likes. Tinder is much better."""
7409:Muneeb Ali,Better than Tinder
"7423:Aaron E,""They finally did it. By removing the two free filters they've made this one of the worst dating apps on the market. It's now just tinder, but more expensive and with a worse user base. No point in using it now. In response to the creators, y'all ruined this app. It's a worse version of Tinder. Hinge did everything Bubble does, but 100x better. Just don't bother with this app. The only worse dating app I've used is PoF."""
7432:Gabriella Machado,I was banned after a few hours of making this account. I didnt even swipe on anyone! So how could I have broken any rules ? And i made sure i followed all directions and was willing to purchase packages to get noticed on the app but I was completely banned for no reason what so ever. I emailed them and have not heard back at all. This is the worst app ever especially for dating!!!! Tinder also sucks but this is the worst dating app I've ever tried.
"7437:Greyson Powell,""Feels a bit less scandalous than Tinder and matches seems to lead to relationships more often, but the most attractive girls are still on Tinder and $30.00 for just one month of premium is very steep."""
7467:Jeremy Shippelt,Months of wasted time with only 1 message. Many of the ladies here expect you to message them first (impossible by design). Many just want more Instagram followers. Many have pretty pictures with virtually no profile. Many are inactive. You would have better luck with PoF or Tinder. Or even IRL (ROFLMAO as if). :(
7552:Laurence Martin,Tinder but worse.
"7673:Ricardo A. Z.,""It's an effective app for dating; nonetheless, I would say Tinder is one step ahead."""
"7771:Nicholas Jones,""Love seeing all the negative reviews because they're all true!!!! Used to be great, but the like limit is so incredibly low now it's ridiculous. More and more features are becoming premium only. App is barely worth using anymore! When I first downloaded it had like a 4 star rating, now it's down to under 3 stars for good reason! That's what happens when you get money hungry! Hinge or Tinder is the way to go!"""
7787:Vinicius Hoyer,Melhor que o Tinder kk
7792:Dave 888,Starts off ok and then you all of a sudden get the same matches over and over again. The app makes no attempt to block people who are here purely to advertise their Instagram profiles. Even when you block people they miraculously appear again. Its actually no better than Tinder.
"7836:Chris Mainwaring,""All you fellas and girls who have had no luck on other apps get this one. It really works, I've been on Tinder, PoF, eHarmony and so many others for years and didn't get so much as a first date. I installed Bumble and within 3 days I got a match with a girl. We have now been together for almost 2 years and are now getting Married thanks to Bumble. Bumble, a dating app that works"""
7890:Revamped Rebel,Tinder but for simps. Simple as that lmao.
"7910:Habiba Akter,""This one of the best dating apps. Altough I am not kinda fan of any dating apps before. Bumble is much much more safer. Heart-felt thanks to it's creator who made it possible for woman to take the step first 👍. Importantly, till now i haven't experienced any harassment or vulgarity as faced it on Tinder. Only one day using Tinder I deleted my account because it's full of disgusting humanoid dogs! Highly recommend the Bumble one!"""
"7914:Alipriyo Biswas,""Best dating app in India at the moment hands down. The women who match are actually genuine and they talk to you. I have tried numerous apps, but I've had way more interactions on bumble than on anything else. And I am free member still. The paid plans are all reasonably priced as well, compared to apps like Tinder."""
"7973:Kyle Ashley,""I hate this app. Just as bad as Tinder, if not worse."""
8069:Heather Parker,Frankly I'm getting pretty tired of the Tinderification of all dating apps. The removal of the two advanced filters for free was the last straw for me. If I wanted to pay I'd use eHarmony or Match.
"8092:JEFFREY MARTIN,""Guys be nice if girls complain you will be kicked of this site forever. You get one opportunity in this life don't blow it. I like this site and the nice ladies more then OK cupid, Tinder and FB combined. Fb is the only one that comes close. This and Hinge are awesome. I like that I can send video clips on here. I like someone to hear and see me before they meet me."""
8099:Awesome Bong,Mera loura ka app h 2match hua h fir v msg nhi kar paa Raha. Socha tha Tinder se accha hoga . Lekin Tinder is the best. Benchodo msg larke log hi pehle karte hai

"8258:Shauna Guglielmo,""Claims to be the safest dating app for women, but what safety features does it actually provide women? A man murdered a woman he net on here, men stalk women after dates. Bumble has done nothing about this! There is no after care to keep women safe. The only thing """"safe"""" is that men can't just randomly message any female on this app. Bumble isn't any more safe than Tinder or OKCupid."""
"8303:Kir-Sheng Chen,""Probably the worst user base. App used to be an wholesome alternative to Tinder but my experience with this app was full of clout chasers looking to promote their social media. The algorithm seems to push more people your way when you're making good progress with a match, and definitely when you're traveling. Look, this app's goal is to make money, not find you love. Look elsewhere if you're genuinely trying to create a healthy and fulfilling relationship."""
8345:Nicholas Laipply,Not a bad app. Definitely better than Tinder. Running into a lot of Christian women though....
8352:Arctic W. Fox,Wow... an app that’s worse than Tinder?
"8404:William Dyce,""Nice design and generally user friendly and comfortable, with few bots. Good if people in your area use it. The trouble with all these Tinder-like apps though is you never know what you're actually paying for. Say you pay for a boost: was your profile actually being shown to anyone before you boosted? Was it shown to anyone after? How many more? There's no way of knowing. The algorithm that determines whose profile gets shown to whom is a black box you can throw money into like a wishing well."""
"8432:Marcus Hughes,""You can tell they got their 'logic' from Tinder. Waste your time if you feel like it, but there's mostly only people who do not know what they want, or Bumble created bots to match with you so you'll be deceived and think they're actually people."""
"8447:Chris Blatner,""Formerly a five-star review, this app has gone way downhill. It went from having all the features Tinder had for free, to some for free, and now you get less features and it costs way more money than Tinder. I get that inflation is a thing, but all these features are something you just lift with a paywall, More people would sign up at a reasonable price. Hinge and tinder are both cheaper and both have niches, bumble is now just the expensive app where women message first, go elsewhere go elsewhe"""
"8464:Benino Juarez,""Bumble was once better than Tinder. Now it's just like junk apps in your phone. I will no longer use Bumble. The developers had something good in their hands, but like most Good Apps, they all come to an end over GREED. My money will now go somewhere else."""
8529:Fruits Valley,Better then Tinder .......
"8587:Tobijah Abrahamsen,""I wish I could give it a negative star like it was a good app back in 2019 I had a few good dates to but now it's just like Tinder, POF and all the other dating apps. you gotta pay for every little thing to """" better your chances"""". And if you do match that it no conversion no dates just a huuuuuge drag. You would have a better chance on Instagram then this app."""
"8625:Justice Alistair,""Other than the numerous dummy accounts (Ex. """"Message me on IG, notifications are OFF"""") similar to the ones you find on Tinder, it's really weird with the swiping. I swipe once, I've hit my quota. I wait 24 hours to swipe again, I've hit my quota. Technically, it's forcing you to pay."""
8630:J. S.,I ignored the reviews. Don't be like me. This app is useless and just a moneygrab. Better off with Tinder
"8633:Elvis Chibundu,""What thing I hate about this app is I don't match with people close to me, Tinder is better in this aspect, one reason I love this app is there are many reasonable people in there Tinder is full of dushbags"""
"8665:Sharbel Kj,""The app use fake likes to make you pay for subscription. The idea of a woman texting first is nice, but that's will never happen. The application interface is very nice. It's better than Tinder. If there's a week free trial, that would be nice to see the app potentials ."""
8739:Harshad Patil,Worth giving it a shot! Better then OKC and Tinder hands down!
"8854:The Dark Lord,""Tinder is better. Don't waste your time with bumble. Unless you pay them money, you get like 10 swipes a day."""
"8859:Doug,""Really gone downhill in order to monetize users. Barely allowed any swipes and even then there's no way to filter without paying. Started using the app less and less over the years. Probably gonna just delete soon. Hinge, Facebook dating, and hell even Tinder are better at this point."""
"8887:Dave Morgan,""This app sometimes takes more than a day to refresh, allows a couple of likes and then decides that's all you're getting again for a random amount of time. Women message first. Unfortunately nobody seems to have told them. Popular profiles are moved to the front of the queue too, so unless you are one of these perfect insta-models, you aren't going to be matching with anyone any time soon without paying over £30 a month. Shame, this app used to be better than Tinder."""

Within 5 minutes I remake my account fully expecting my purchase to Transfer over to my NEW bumble profile (I've done it many many times on Tinder and the purchase/subscription renews upon reaching maximum number of swipes) NOT ON BUMBLE they just stole 40 dollars from me, and now when I go to look at the prices for the service??

I'm going to have to wade through dozens of profiles that say """"Want someday"""" on kids and cannot select a preference for height. What the devil are you playing at, Bumble?

Get it together, Bumble! You used to be the numero uno app!"""
"9307:derek jobe,""Basically I pay $30 a month for this app just so I can match with 2 people a month, who then want me to partake in some three way, with their current parter. Had I known that these were the users on this app, I would've stuck to Tinder."""

When I expressed this to customer support on multiple occasions, the continued useless response I get is a list of their guidelines. Again, I am 100% compliant with them so knock off the BS and listen to your complaints. Use Tinder, FB Dating or POF instead. The verification actually works and the customer support is not grotesquely incompetent."""
"11274:Mohammed,""EIGHT matches on Tinder, ZERO match on Bumble, so either Bumble people are too picky, or the algorithm is weak af (Hint: it's the latter)."""
11413:Alex Conway,Basically just a sexist Tinder so if you're into that then cool.
"11421:Saleh Hashmi,""God you guys have become even worse than Tinder. What the hell, your going to retain my data even after account has been deleted? Atleast tinder deletes it right away. This point really shows the womensk leadership in the company. Only a women would to keep posted on its exs. I already talked to the team. And they want me to send more info just to delete it. So what now you can get bank accounts under my name too? I am being sarcastic but come on. Who the asks for gov. id. card for a dating app?"""
"11434:jacob jones,""It works. At least for me I've never had any bugs or issues with the app and Ive met a fair amount of women off Bumble. The problem I think is that Bumble is very pricey compared to Tinder, it's very unappealing to pay bumble $29.99 a month versus tinder $64.99 for a year. Bumbles lifetime subscription also seems very overpriced for $149.99. Bumble claims to be a more premium experience for women where they have the control, but that's at the cost to the men. Solid app, to pricey though."""
11456:Secret One,Constantly the apps takes forever to show people and when it does it only shows a few...I have changed my settings and it does the same... This all happened after I went premium 🤔🤔🤔 before then I wasn't having this problem.. Needless to say I will not renew. Tinder performs better.
11484:Something_Else,Just like Tinder this apps algorithms are designed for extortion and social influencing/manipulation.
11532:Justin Anderson,Bumble used to be better. In it's humble beginnings it was an honest dating app which helped people out of their comfort zones and make some real success stories. I think it took a turn for the worse when it became popular and undistinguishable from Tinder. I hardly get any likes compared to other dating apps so there's no motivation or incentive to be an active user. I feel like online dating has started to take a backseat to going out and meeting honest people in real life. No bots though!
11605:Katie Finkbeiner,Tinder and this app are terrible
"11636:Seben Griffin IV,""This is one of, if not the DUMBEST dating apps I've been on. The fact that the app is designed to where girls have to make the first move is stupid in and of itself. Women hate making the first move! Anybody who knows anything about women would know that. I've paid for I don't know how many of those spotlights, and it did nothing. The premium version doesn't give you any better results than the free version. You're just dishing out money for no reason. Bumble is trash. Try your luck with Tinder"""
11704:Aritra Roy,Better than Tinder and hinge combined lol
"11717:C J,""Congratulations, Bumble. You managed to create an app more useless than Tinder. 👏"""
"11779:Pat OneGuy,""The app is buggy, causing swiping to be unavailable for days on end, they charge more than Tinder without really delivering anything worthwhile, and if you aren't paying they seem to actively keep anyone who has swiped on you out of your feed to try to create a soft paywall."""
"11812:Majora489,""I intended to use the app's subscription for one month. Everything on my account indicated that my subscription would end on December 5th. Hidden within the terms and conditions, Bumble can auto renew your subscription. Additionally, even if you delete the app Bumble can still charge you. Bumble uses underhanded legalize to get your money for a sub-par experience. I'm in my 20s and male. I thought I created profile that display my personality well. Within the month on Bumble, I received maybe 5 likes. I started using Tinder; 12 likes within the first few hours. I actually get responses from women on Tinder. There are more worthwhile apps and at lower costs too."""
"11882:jake daly,""Better than tinder because there less bits but unless you loom like Manuel Ferrara your not gonna get a natural match, only gonna get paid matches and even the it's not enough matches that send the first message[lady's message boys]. Better tha. Tinder but you'd better be prepared to """"date down"""" if you want """"a lot of dates."""""""
"11975:Carmelo Rivera,""Used to be good but now 98% of the profiles are obviously fake. Reporting fake profiles even when they are completely fake doesn't yield results, even for paid subscriptions all you'll get is flocked by these fake profiles as if the algorithm uses you to report them. This app is not too far from being overrun by fake profiles looking to promote IG and SC accounts just like Tinder. It's easy ban social media handles or usernames completely, maybe you'll have less profiles but better quality."""
"12007:N,""Somehow worse than Tinder, didn't think that was possible."""
"12041:Taylor G,""They claim to operate on personality but allow for about as many characters in bio as Tinder. The first screen that loads is a payment plan offer EVERY TIME. They also have the worst ad delivery mechanism, which in my case was sending a notification that I had a match and presenting me with an ad when I clicked it. Be a less bad cash grab."""
12162:Bob Hazy,Better than Match and Tinder.
"12241:John Doe,""There doesn't seem to be much activity on this app. My Tinder account (same pictures, similar bio, etc.) easily gets at least 3 times as many matches. And when I do match with someone, they just let the match expire without starting the conversation. Or maybe they just never got the memo?"""
"12245:James Luquette,""I used Bumble years ago and it was fine back then (actually met a very good friend thanks to bumble), however it doesn't seem to be worth the time now. I've had bumble for an entire month and I have literally not gotten 1 single match at all. Yet other apps like Tinder and Facebook dating I've gotten plenty of matches. Not sure what the deal is, seems like you have no luck unless you're willing to pay overpriced subscriptions. Maybe you can have better luck than me, but I recommend other apps."""
12267:Charles D,Bumble is trash! Accounts get deleted after a day and there is absolutely no customer support. Honestly Tinder is better now
"12294:david mellors,""My review keeps getting deleted. Very feminist app. Anti guys. They ban you for little to no reason, They give you zero feedback on your ban then they link your pictures and card details to the banned account. Just use Tinder instead"""
12363:vignesh vichu,Not matches happening like Tinder. Had huge expectations that it would be better than Tinder but totally disappointed
"12378:Powdered-Toast Man,""I hate online dating sites, I only got this bc my friends wouldn't stop bugging me to get it. It's a cool concept, but it went as expected only getting matches with bots :/. Lowered it to 1 star bc apparently getting premium is pointless. You get to see who likes you but you don't get at least one spotlight free? Tinder gives you one free boost and 5 super likes along with unlimited swipes and seeing who liked you before matching. Greedy."""
"12451:G Luke Harris,""Tried over and over and over to log back in to my old account, but when I try to set it back up I get to the profile picture, try to select a picture, and all it says is """"Something went wrong..."""". I've tried over and over for YEARS to see if it would ever fix itself and it never did. I'd much rather use this app over Tinder but at least Tinder actually you know... WORKS so... this app sucks."""
12599:Kristin Allen,Sooo much better than Tinder!
12631:Zac Likes Cauliflower,This app is just sub-par Tinder lol
12667:Nikhil Deshpande,Noone going to notice here. And noone going to message you here. Tinder is best atles I got 10-12 messages and meet up as well. BUMBLE is here only to fool you. DONT INSTALL IT MY FRIEND.
"12691:A,""An improved model from Tinder and co. The filters could work better: to exclude people who selected a category, not include only those people who selected an option. The way it currently works, you exclude people who leave fields blank. Also, """"Liberal"""" means something different outside of US - you need to internationalize/regionalize better."""
12755:Samuel Caballero,All the pain of Tinder but none of the matches
"12757:Deandra Neretlis,""I like the function to turn off dating. But quite frankly, I'm used to Tinder. The setup here is not easy, you have to double tap the photo to read, vs Tinder the bio is there and you only double tap for more pics. I can't stand the feature where you have to message within 24 hours, it just does not work when people are busy. This only promotes people redirecting matches to IG or SC, which I don't have, and I'm looking for in person friends, not some random new follow on social media."""
"12846:Mantas Navickas,""The idea is decent but the execution is poor. The app just doesn't have enough people using it and Bumble really strong hands you into buying their premium features otherwise you are likely not getting any matches... A shame, but I'd suggest using their competitors like Tinder, Badoo or Hinge."""
12880:Stefan Ilivanov,Another Tinder clone without much real profiles and which high prices for every function which should be free
"12956:Deepen Wadhwa,""My only complaints are that the premium service is a bit too expensive and you get seen by less and less people as the days go by, premium or not, but that's about it! This is wayyy better than Tinder still. Tinder stole my money twice without any refund or upgrade..."""
"13091:Ace van Cleef,""Reading profile is enjoyable and better structured than on Tinder. What I wish bumble improves are: 1) Increase spotlight duration to 2 hours or more 2) After 24h run out, give men the opportunity to take the initiative, simply because most women prefer men taking the first step. This is how they are socially conditioned and thus Bumble's approach is well-intended but leads to actually having no text convo even getting started. Uhoh."""
13100:Larry Peters,It's damn bear impossible to meet anyone. There's TONS and TONS of fake profiles. It's just a boring dating app. Just as bad as Tinder
13188:Nachiket K,Tinder is way better. No option to see all the right swiped profiles at a glance as in Tinder. I can decide to super swipe based on what options I have in total.
13228:John Somerlott,A) I just got threatened to have my account suspended because I tried to post a young picture of me and for one with friends??? B) The matching algorithm seems mutch more of a cash grab than Tinder & Hinge. C) some days it says there is nobody in my area but I have a strong feeling that is not the case because the next day I'll have a couple dozen before I run out of swipes.
"13240:Gilberto Quiroz-Rea,""Overall much better than Tinder, the app is what you make of it. I subscribed to Premium & although don't match with everyone I'd like, the quality of people are much better than other apps. Be warned, they don't do refunds & if you react to someone's photo it automatically likes them which really upset me. I'd give 5 stars if they allowed us to upgrade previous like to a Super swipe (since it doesn't allow rewinds on likes), & if it lets you react to a photo while Super swiping instead of like"""
13275:Rama krishna Dutt,It's actually waaaaay better than Tinder!!
"13286:Stone Cold,""Very very bad application, It has very few swipes and takes very long time to get refresh to the new swipes. I have been using Bumble from last 9 10 months nobody matches at all. If they match they dont send you message, and if they send you message they unmatch within an hour. Totally waste of time and money. You get nothing from this app. Atleast Tinder gives you some match than this app."""
"13363:DarkerThan Black,""Great Value Tinder Not only do you have to match with people at a high enough percentage; you also need to wait until your match initiates the conversation which is also another layer of number games. Then, unless you pay, you're unlikely to ever see all your hidden likes no matter how much you swipe. Defintely feels like they stall account viewe and interactions. They certainly can boost them.."""
"13366:Vasilios Magriplis,""It's Tinder except the woman has to message first within 24 hours. Problem is most matches expire without the woman ever initiating contact, which gets old fast. Combine that with the profiles that are clearly on there to promote their Instagram, and you're left with an app that's even less effective than Tinder for dating (which is already a very low bar)."""
"13416:Matthew Millar,""I regularly get hit on by women on the street age 26-56 and have had great success with dating. Using Bumble was a joke. I had 5% of the matches with Tinder.

"13525:Lennart Kehrberger,""Dadurch das beide Seiten schreiben müssen, verhindert die App das man aus Schreibfaulheit Matches sammelt und stattdessen tatsächlich ins schreiben kommt und eventuell sogar trifft. Durch Bumble hatte ich trotz weniger Matches mehr Dates wie durch Tinder."""
13716:Nigel H.,Slightly better than Tinder.
"13738:Chris,""The unique idea of this app is that women need to make the first step after matching (same swipe principle as Tinder or other apps). However it seems like they are not making this clear to the female users: Although having a vast amount of matches around 90% (yes, even more) won't contact you. If they do they complain they always have to do the first step. Some women even write they expect the man to take initiative. Conclusion: this concept won't work without proper user education."""
"13781:Oliver Nuttall,""Seems dead, out of the matches I got a good 80% don't even message within the 24 hour period they have. Happens far too often Oh and if you want to cancel your premium make sure you check the tiny, nondescript """"active until"""" button which is ridiculously unclear that it is actually the management button or you'll get charged for extra that you don't even want Don't bother, out of Tinder and Hinge this has been the absolute worst of those three for matches and conversation"""
13852:Sybrand van Wyk,Much better than Tinder. Wish more women matched me though. Guess I'll have to get an app to improve my profile.
13901:Dukedipper 423,Tinder's better. This app will block your account if a match even remotely reports you. And fyi dont waste any money on it
"13905:Larks Tongues In Aspic,""Bumble algorithm kinda sucks. It brings the most desirable people to top of the cards, so if you're not in the top 10% desirable people, chances are you won't even show up in people's queues. And people who WOULD swipe right on you and like your style, will actually never see your profile. Unlike Tinder which puts people with similar level of desirability on top of each other's queues and that way even if your profile isn't super popular, at least it's still being seen and you will have matches"""
13916:Naisarg Raval,Honestly I had much expectations with this app but NO. I'm giving this app 1 star because it doesn't provide much even after purchasing premium plan. I think even spotlight and superlike don't work. You can't even reverse a person you've just liked if you want to change your mind. It only works if you dislike them. If you want to spend the money spend it on Tinder. It's better than this.
"13955:clark main,""Wish I could give it zero stars. Don't waste your money, it's garbage. A bunch of fake profiles just telling you to follow them on social media, worse than Tinder. The app won't refund any money either. Total trash."""

14409:DJ MeechyMeech,This app feels like it has maybe 90% less people than tinder. But it's better than tinder because the connections seem more genuine. Tinder is just a big scam and waste of money. Tinder will ban you for no reason. Bubble seems to be more reliable.
14412:Kashif,Pathetic dating app. No matter how good your profile is or you buy subscription. It won't give you matches. It seems like a straight scam. Editing my review just to inform you that I have already sent you multiple emails but you never reply on them. Tinder is far better than this!!
14449:Aria Dickson,Tinder is free an you can choose up to what distance to find people but have to pay for locations on bumble..very disappointing cant set distance range on bumble for free like Tinder

Better than Tinder but still not great.
"15262:Dorian,""As far as online dating goes, this is probably the best app to use. It much better than Tinder, though that is setting the bar very low. The 24h chance to reconsider makes for less but more engaging interactions, so it feels like less time wasted.

"16747:Nathanael Taylor,""Grindr is a better. Yes, really. I spent a couple weeks on here, and despite being told I had over 40 people who had liked my profile, only matched with three the entire time. So much stuff is locked behind a pay wall. You're better off on Grindr or Tinder."""
16749:Lord Lynn,Bumble is great in comparison to Tinder but I think Hinge is even better
"16887:Sam Walker,""Love bumble, overall a MUCH better app than Tinder, only wish there was a way to add anthems or specific songs to profiles 😕"""
16894:Richelle Limburg,A lot better than Tinder! More enjoyable and a bit more serious than Tinder ��

Didn't like it, is designed so girls can have a handful of dudes (like if they were in need!), my roomie literally has around 20 guys, so take a seat and wait for your turn. Need trans filter to avoid them showing up."""
16964:The Pharoah,Bumble is unfortunately just another swipe mini game like Tinder. Seeing who liked you is hidden behind a $30/month pay wall.
16986:Shashi Karkhanis,It's a wonderful app and much better than Tinder. I don't use credit card so unable to use debit card also. Hope the team helps me. Thanks
"17050:Jake Bowman,""Waste of time. Bumble has you register your number but actually doesn't save it. You can't """"log in"""". So if you break your phone or go to use bumble on a different phone, you are unable to access it and it's lost forever. This is another reason why I didn't use it often. Now I don't use it at all! Tinder will always be supreme to bumble."""
"17217:jay C23,""Tl;Dr - great UI UX but app has too many obstacles that holds guys back from its bread and butter - matches. The good: Clean UI UX, and I particularly love the Q prompts which sets up fun convos. The bad: Matches are VERY hard to come by. It's the same in all apps, but Bumble makes it even harder unless you're blessed in the looks department. You have to match and pray the girl deigns to text you FIRST AND do it within 24 hours. Very rarely happens, and so you're better off on CmB or Tinder."""

I reported this fault more than a week ago and still have not received a reply. I ended up deleting the app and installed Tinder which seems to work better."""
17325:Andrew taylor,Way better than Tinder
"17326:Ben Monger,""I was told how amazing this app was and sounded so different then apps like Tinder however now signing up to it I can see someone else must be running it now because it's no different from Tinder, if fact by the sounds of comments it's far worse then Tinder"""
"17340:Daniel Davis,""Worst dating app. You basically have to have a paid subscription to get matches. Women talk first and most match, but don't respond before the match expires (coincidentally, because a paid sub can extend). Had 30 matches I never saw because you have to pay to unlock them. Stick to Tinder, at least you can use it without paying for it."""
17483:Xavi JJ,Good n less biased matching n refers 80% accurate partner in any gender n location mostly suggest unear by n most appreciated suggestions as compared you one's own profile .

"17567:Lakshay rao,""1. Doesn't let you know how many coins you still have. This led to confusion and buy more. 2. When touched the superswipe option to check if have coins left, they directly deducted €8. 3. Doesn't let you cancel the subscription or(depending on the counrty region) 'Unlink' your card details leading to deduct unwanted subscription charges consecutively. 4. Charges you more than tinder while this platform doesn't have 1/5th of Tinder's userbase. 5. Customer support sucks."""

Got one email back with information I already knew. They stopped responding again when I emailed back. Overall, I find the app slightly better than Tinder (low bar). I like the how you can give extra info in your profile besides your bio. The question prompts are also a nice addition. Beyond that, it's pretty standard fare for a free dating app. Same false hope."""
"17716:Leon gotget,""This, is not a free app. They give you 2-3 days of swiping, then you hit a """"daily"""" swipe limit (which hadn't appeared before despite me being more active the first few days I got the app). waiting a day does nothing if you are in a low population density area like I am. Through some quick research online it seems if you live in a big city it might reset but you will hit you daily limit every 10-15 swipes. Do yourself a favor and download Tinder if you are able."""
17785:Steve Stasa,I bought lifetime in January (2021) after a few conversations didn't lead anywhere. I haven't had a message since. Same profile on Tinder and Hinge still gets occasional conversations. Really feels like I got scammed.
"17899:Brandon Petroski,""Genuinely one of the most sexist apps ever made, just because the CEO was getting harassed at Tinder. Overpriced garbage subscription model meant to prey on desperate people."""
"17904:Darrell Wernsman,""Honestly, highly disappointed. Wish I could get my money back. Nothing even remotely local to me. On top of that you have to really look closely at the profiles, they say your town or city in big letters but right underneath it's a different state entirely. Buying premium does jack all to help meet new people. Limiting the messages to only females being able to message is also a pain. I ran across more fake profiles than Tinder has. I wish I could give it 0 stars and hadn't wasted any time."""
"17924:Travis Mida,""It's a good app, especially if you compare it to Tinder. There are far less bots here than other apps. I like the fact that women have to message me first when we match. I feel like if I do end up in a relationship, it will probably be because of this app, and not any of the other ones. UPDATE AS OF 9/2/21: I noticed boosts are much more worth their price if you buy them in bulk, and you can use 2 for a total of 150 minutes. Thank you for doing this! ❤️"""
"17967:Luke Eros,""How is this better than Tinder? Way less matches and users in general, a lot of unresolved bugs and the same money model where you have to pay to do anything... In other words - don't waste your time on this"""
18143:June Piper-Brandon,Just a step above Tinder.
18151:AfternoonLemon,Message notifications need some work (same as Tinder!) but otherwise good app!
"18186:Bradley,""I once described it as a """"Wal-Mart Tinder"""" but I kept trying. I am still not impressed. Good idea? Yes, but unfortunately you lose a lot of matches because for one reason or another a woman just doesn't message first. Why is anybody's guess, nerves, lack of interest, accidental right swipe, forgot to check the app, etc. The algorithm needs some work. If I filter out women with kids I get 3-5 swipes but as soon as I turn that off there are exponentially more women with no kids. Figure that out."""
18231:Aaryan,Great app guys. Bumble > Tinder
"18239:aditya mish,""The spotlight and boost features are a joke.. just money making strategies, hardly getting the matches. Tinder is much better in this case, atleast you get matches while boosting. Save your time and talk to a girl in the pub instead, higher probability to date that way."""
"18248:Aygun Doruk,""This app is even worse than the money grabbing Tinder. Go for Happn, that dating app is better."""
"18360:Michael Rotelli,""Absolute garbage. In the same time while using Tinder, Hinge, CMB and OkC, I had likes, matches and conversations with unique, real users on all of them. On Bumble I had no matches or even any likes. I'm not *that* ugly."""
18363:Gabriela S.,So much better than Tinder
18379:Nicholas Rodriguez,Trash just like Tinder
18382:David Kairu,Tinder is the ghetto.. love Bumble
"18438:Maitreyi Dhar,""Overall Worst App. Tinder is better than this as you can't see who like you until you pay for premium. Basically, you can't use this app unless you pay for the premium."""
18462:Steve H,Better people than Tinder
"18498:Ashutosh Pandey,""Have been using for 6 months now, not a single match yet. Free version is of no use. On Tinder atleast you get matches even on free version."""
18533:Lance,Roughly 2 years ago I installed Bumble. After a couple days I got my first match. Here we are now engaged and planning a wedding for next fall. All in all I had a much more success vs Tinder
"18553:Mr Nickwan,""Terrible concept and terrible application of that concept. The whole point of the app is that women message first but they never do. I never have an issue starting conversations, keeping them going or even the women messaging first on other dating apps. The app also routinely tries to make you purchase premium by matching you with people outside of your requirements. Honestly just download Tinder or Hinge."""
"18556:Chris Summers,""Can't believe anything can be worse than Tinder but here it is, Bumble! Almost no activity from women. It's quite barren for dating, in NZ. Most of the ladies use Tinder instead Response to Dev comment: Yes I have, I've tried everything, including """"spotlight"""". Same results, or lack thereof!"""
"18568:Sage Skylight,""With other apps like Tinder, Badoo or even Grindr and SeekingArrangement in the dating game, one would think that certain features would come free of charge but this app tries to get our money as if """"finding love"""" had a price or as if the app begged for it, which is very displeasing; if these features continue as they are i'll soon do as my friends and just erase the app for the unnecessary annoyance... stick to the other ones."""
"18581:Tim Beck,""Lame app. Even when paying for premium, I got hardly any matches - unlike Tinder - and far fewer messages. Most of the profiles I perused were from other locations, but the app shows profiles based on physical location of a device despite the user listing their living location. Unless deliberately using travel mode, profiles that are displayed should default to where the users physically live. If I set my distance limit to 50 miles, I have no interest in users across the country."""
18597:Rustam S,Overall.. it's better than most dating apps but some of the features are quite restricted. Besides..it should market itself else Tinder still gets the chunk of the population. I mean that. More freedom on the change of name and search filters could do without a subscription. Seriously.
"18632:Emanuel Falade,""Full of catfish, at least Tinder has confirmation."""
"18640:Daniel,""Basically unusable without premium. Also pretty sure you guys deleted my last review. Nice one. A few years ago was pretty much seen as the app to rescue us all from Tinder, but now it is way more restrictive than Tinder. Ironic"""
"18681:Michael Stallings,""New review. Tinder is better. Atleast on tinder u only wait 12 hrs to match more people instead of waiting over 24 hrs. Plus if a girl marches u afyer u swiped them days before, u don't have to wait for them to write you, only for them to not text u fast enough and lose the match. Not everyone wants to text multiple people at once. NOT GOING TO BLOW YOUR SM UP FOR YOU. THIS APP SUCKS. TINDER SUCKS TOO BUT ATLEAST ITS BETTER."""
"18708:Taylor Vernon,""Cute app that operates similarly to Tinder. Difference is that you are not only locked into dating. You can specify that you're using it for friends (Bumble BFF) or for networking as well. I personally intend to use it for networking once I'm halfway finishing with school. I would recommend it to anyone looking to date, find some friends if they're new to an area, or wanting to expand their network."""
18722:Adi nz,real hard to remove the suspension(cancel the payment). they don't have that option on the Bumble app! (Tinder has it) that feel like this company behave like a Mafia (criminals). Also they use algorithm to block reduce the numbers of girls around u. u will see maybe 10% of the all number of girls!
18752:Kingfarathor,You need the option to block people by phone numbers on here I found my ex wife on here and some of her friends please fix this issue and add the fixture that Tinder has and other dating apps have. Also need to add a hobbies and interests filters. I'm looking for a game nerd in my area that doesn't have kids and is very outgoing. Please also fix and add this. Your app filters are restricting only limiting to 2 filter options this is ridiculous.
"18755:Andrew Ellis,""Compared to Tinder, Bumble feels good to use as far as user experience goes. I honestly love it, but since it's a dating app, I have to deduct a point."""
"18877:John Estrada,""Genuine review here. I have Bumble, Tinder and Hinge. Out of all three, Bumble is by far the worst. I very rarely get matched with someone. I'll usually match with someone almost daily with Tinder. Hinge is by far the best because I do match with someone if not multiple people daily. My profile pictures and descriptions and virtually the same across all three platforms. I give two stars because I HAVE matched with people but maybe only once a month.."""
"18919:C.A. Milson,""Can't exactly see how this is different to any other """"dating"""" site or app. """"women respond first"""" concept is not a game-changer, nor is it any different to Tinder, POF or any one of the thousands of dating apps/websites that there is on the market. As Bumble states """"On Bumble, women always make the first move. If she doesn't initiate a conversation within 24 hours, the connection expires"""" """"If a man swipes right on a person he is interested in, she also has to do the same"""". How is that different than the rest of the dating apps? It is not. """"Women have to make the first move"""" has been around since the dawn of dating agencies. If you really want something that is a """"real"""" game changer, how about where women do actually make the first move and swiping right, instead of the men having to waste their time by doing the chasing for zero interest."""
"19120:jarrod mcgahan,""Superior to tinder in almost every way. Tinder will give you matches right when you install or reinstall (after a long period of absence), then in order to try to persuade you to promote yourself, they secretly limit matches. I get 2-3 matches a day on bumble, while it has been over a week in tinder since my last match. That's real guys. Gj bumble for NOT using monetization tactics that are underhanded like tinder."""
19197:Andrew Hastie,I emailed bumble support to get my subscription restored after it disappeared. Never received a response back after multiple inquiries. Don't waste your time or money on this app. Stick with Tinder.

Why doesn't it use the registered email that opened the account. No doubt they will reply to this and say contact Bumble on their email (which they don't reply) or will send Twitter or Facebook link...... Painful"""
19346:Swati Dhawan,Bumble should really review their strategy..Limiting the number of profiles is only limiting their popularity....No other app does that....Mostly people prefer Bumble because there are genuine profiles and weeds out all unwanted profiles...They have the advantage over Tinder where its has really got weird and i think out of hands from Tinder team that you see so many bot profies r couples coming up for threesomes only because its easy to make profile.So Bumble should look into this gap.
"19355:Joe Fox,""Can be an easy breezy matching app, or you can write a longer profile. Compared to Tinder, it was better for finding people who wanted to meet."""
19387:Tom Smith,Terrible compared to Tinder which is a shame cause the girls on Bumble seem to be more serious about dating. There's no rewind button which sucks cause I always accidentally hit X instead of ✔ and they drip feed you matches to keep you paying. Hinge and Tinder are way better.
19440:Justin Stothers,Serves it's purpose and not overly expensive if you do decide to upgrade unlike tinder. Tinder is stupid expensive and no I'm not being paid to say that. I refuse to spend money on that app.
"19449:Duston Smith,""Should we call Bumble, baby Tinder now?! Bunch of likes but never seem to get a match. Now they up their minimum price to $14 just so you can see who liked you. Use to like Bumble, not anymore."""
"19486:Sebinsol,""When there are pay walls blocking key features, that's one thing but they legitimately block you from even matching completely unless you pay up. It SAYS """"done for today"""" but it has been 3 days since it blocked me from matching so I uninstalled. Don't waste your time, many make profiles are for validation or scams so even though other apps like POF and Tinder are also wastes of time, they at least let you use the app"""

"19567:Dusk Moonblade,""Going by reviews read, this is a shittier app then Tinder, and Tinder is nothing but a bot fest."""
"19598:Mephirez,""I cannot believe they jacked the price of premium up so high. You can purchase a FULL MONTH of Tinder platinum (Tinder's top of the top subscription) for cheaper than you can buy a single week of Bumble premium. On top of that, the app no longer even puts people that have swiped right on me into my feed, when it used to do so regularly. Absolute waste of time."""
"19603:Casey Z,""I'm female and prefer Tinder over this. This software is slower and has a few technical glitches. Making women text first is a giant mistake and pointless (if contact is only possible when both ppl swipe yes). User base is way smaller.

(The difference being, on bumble they try to sound politically correct about it and waste more of ur time.)"""

20119:Omar Sobh,Tinder auf wish bestellt. Die Idee finde ich cool. Die App aber leider nicht.

I'll stick to Tinder then."""
20525:Nomad,I'm not gonna rate it low just because I don't get matches. There are limited daily swipes unlike Tinder. You can't see likes. Otherwise it's okay. 5/5 because it doesn't have ads like Badoo. Why is that a thing?

22258:Neal Howard,Great dating ap. Not the spam Tinder has
22261:mrminiature11,I'd give it a 5 star if it wasn't priced so badly. If the prices were more inline with Tinder this would be easily the best dating app and I'd happily pay for those extra features.
22277:Aiden G,This app is far better than most dating apps. As long as you have patience. I paid for the subscription which unlike other dating apps doesn't scam you. The ability for women to message first creates this environment that's less creepy than an app like Tinder. If you live in an area with a lot of people this app is great. I do wish that you could view all the profiles of the people you swiped left on. It's a small issue but it's one that I noticed.
22291:Alienistic Oddities,10/10 for Bumble :3 It's like Tinder but without all the bullying and less people looking for hookups. It's a genuinely good app for finding platonic friends too - which is hard in this day and age.
"22456:Zac Crist,""Horrible, got banned from this app, and Tinder. Too many people get offended these days."""
"22481:Alex N,""Bunch of fake profiles, might as well call it Tinder now. And nobody with integrity likes tinder... Edit: still fake. Also they won't let me sign in anymore,.never verifies my phone number when I put the code in. Weird!"""
"22497:Kayla,""I found my partner after messaging him on this app. Compared to Tinder, Bumble connections feel more real and personalized. There's a great batch of different types of people to swipe on and even befriend or date. My only complaint was the swipe limits. Tinder can go on endlessly, meanwhile Bumble is very limited without premium. It's up to the user if it's worth the cost for a subscription."""
"22592:D. W,""Compared to other dating apps I've used this is by far the best one, BUT it's too freaking expensive, honestly if you keep the price similar or less than Tinder i can guarantee you'd have many subscribers."""
"22660:Thomas Sureau,""The app has been hacked. Do not use the IN feature that opens after a few messages. Been this way for a while, and also applies to Tinder. But since this isn't a data breach, they're not required to report it by law. But it's a major PR issue. Just be aware."""
"22662:A S,""Had this app for maybe a week and already getting phantom matches, but can't see who I matched with unless I uninstall then reinstall. Back to Tinder..."""
"22813:James Bestbier,""Your algorithms are garbage. Tinder remains the gold standard, and that says all that needs to be said. How utterly embarrassing"""
23012:Dimitrios Chatzos,The problem with the matches is the biggest and important one. If you don't pay the App may let you without match days and days. The premium is 30 euros per month and Tinder 18/20euros per month. You need to change your charge policy and fix the amount of swipes someone can do.
"23052:Ashish Saikia,""Although the unique features of this app is quite good but the ultra-feminist approach is very much annoying. If it would have been like Tinder then it could have gain widespread popularity among the masses. This feature is also hampering your market. We all know that women usually doesn't make the first move, specially towards a stranger. I hope the owner and the marketing team will understand this thing. Other than that the other features are upto the mark.."""
23094:nick dorsey,Cons you into spending money by intentionally limiting who sees your profile and how many people you can swipe on. Discriminates against gun owners by moderating photos. Welcome to feminist Tinder 🤷🏻‍♂️
23150:Noel Torres,Bumble is such a great experience! Forget about Tinder!
"23329:henriquè Nare,""Hey I thought the comments were wrong or over-exaggurating but here we are. Bro just use Tinder, unfortunately it's better and doesn't have much of a payment hurdle unlike this app"""
23348:Tim Bur,Poor app. Tinder is better.
23381:Luke ಥ‿ಥ,It's not Tinder
"23401:arjun kapoor,""Pretty disappointed. My picture with absolutely no issues gets moderated and support has not gotten back to me. I get plenty of matches on Hinge / Tinder, none on bumble."""
23443:Alex Lavenus,Just stick to Tinder
23479:Henry Langford,Better than Tinder at least.
"23486:Michele Schultz,""Bumble used less megabytes especially if it's a hybrid unless if you're seeking to network and expand your female friend group. Bumble filter will stay in the location of who you want to date, meetup via BFF, and Bizz. Out of Facebook dating, Tinder, Hinge, Bumble used less megabytes if you use all three."""
23525:Kabu Doe,This app is trash. I experienced nothing but glitches and ghosts... better off with Tinder ffs.
"23540:Jimirio,""I downloaded the app and matched someone instantly that I already really like. I used Tinder for days and it was just full of hollow headed thots. And girls message first, so you know they are interested. Okay, I'm a believer. Results possibly not typical."""
23567:Drinking Bleach,Absolutely dogshit. Just get Tinder
"23580:David A,""Honestly a lot better than Tinder, just not as many people. I love that the photo verification was added, but it would be better if photo verification was required before swiping on anyone to prevent scammers & catfishing. Bff & biz section is very unique, bff could be improved by allowing people to swipe on the opposite sex though."""
"23636:Fareed _,""I almost never write reviews on apps, but I’ve been compelled to do so in this case because of how badly their support staff has been in responding to my requests for an explanation as to why I can’t log into the app. I’ve had Bumble for a long time, I even bought the lifetime subscription for it, but as of last week, I haven’t been able to log into the app. I tried reaching out to the app’s support staff through Twitter, Facebook, email, and their “contact us” form on their support page, and still no response. At this point I’m assuming they’ve blocked my account, and are just good with losing a paying customer without giving an explanation as to why I’ve been blocked. I wouldn’t recommend supporting an app like this when other apps (Tinder, Hinge) give you a similar experience without the lack of transparency. PS. If you look through the 1 star reviews on this app, you'll see that bumble has responded to almost everyone by saying to message them on twitter or email them at their support email address. I'm expecting such a response on this review too. The sad part is that I've been trying to reach out to them through both these methods, and I've only gotten complete radio silence."""
23656:Matt Brown,Like Tinder but there aren't fake profiles here
23761:evueneD redarhcS,New to the app. So far very convenient and smart. Similar to Tinder and more expensive but I like the features. Let see how goes.
"23867:James Bischoff,""Have always enjoyed Bumble...quick, efficient and female making first contact is a smart/interesting feature. The 'upgrades' are a bit expensive....might want to revisit pricing, maybe a 30% drop influenced enough new 'users' to create a net/net profit--? Consider. But, again, my experience with the app has been positive and would recommend over Tinder to any one who asks. Be well. Jay"""
24005:hu3,Pleasantly surprised. Better alternative to Tinder and with some interesting inbuilt features.
"24073:Abhinav,""Maybe I'm unattractive and have a boring bio but with identical bio and pictures I get hanful of matches on Tinder every week. My conclusion is that unless you're paying for their services, your profile will automatically will placed lower in the queue (if shown at all) by their algorithm."""
"24128:Eldon Coutinho,""I use to like this app. Quite different from Tinder. and you used to get some genuine matches. However,of late the team seems to have resorted to the sort of profile management, that the profile that likes you has been pulled off from the list you get to swipe. They resort to this means in order to make you pay to find out the likes. Either that I genuinely aint recieving profiles that liked me. Either way my moneys on the former. I might delete the app if the problem continues."""
"24180:Vinyl Wrapper,""Honestly so far the best app. I got engaged to my last Tinder date, turns out I was super wrong. Here the fact that women have the power to make the first move helps a lot on matching with people who are actually interested in knowing you. Can't wait to get engaged (and hopefully marry) my first Bumble date as I haven't been on a date from Bumble yet. It will be the last first date with Bumble's help :) Love the app so far."""
24207:Bird Harris,I've spoken to and met as many women using Candy Crush as a dating app as I have using Bumble. Except Candy Crush hasn't wasted any of my time because I've never played it. I don't know if I've been shadow banned for some unknown reason or maybe I'm just that ugly. So save your time and don't bother with this. Edit: I've had multiple friends optimise my profile for what they look for when swiping. Tinder seems to be the better option still.
"24238:Juan David Vanegas,""The likes you give to others doesn't appear to them ever instead they pay. It also is the same with the likes you receive. They could have invented a fairer system as Tinder which I still prefer to use, even to pay"""
24257:Vijay Motla,Worst app i am using to 2 months continuously but no match yet. This app just waste your time. Tinder is better then this app. I will never recommend for using this app.
"24354:Sharky LeBlanc,""The description is contradictory to how it works. It doesn't help you meet people or chat. I've never met anyone from here, and it's been months since I've talked to anyone here, despite using it daily, and (regrettably) spending plenty of money on it. This is the one big name app that isn't owned by Match Group, but you wouldn't know it by looking at it. They keep updating to basically become Tinder 2. Also, please add a character minimum for the initial message thing."""
24408:pratik astro saha,It seriously doesn't favour the male demographic. Almost never your account gonna pop up cause you don't pay money for it . It's worse than Tinder and I mean it
"24465:Mohammad Sharifi,""Bumble advertises a great idea, but is highly inefficient. My experience is that you get couple matches the first couple days, and then they stop showing your profile to people. instead they start pushing you to pay for Spotlight etc. I think Tinder is a very random app but still better than Bumble. If you think I'm biased there's also an article by Treena Orchard about her experience with Bumble. I personally don't recommend this app as its method is not working. Edit 2021-still the same issue."""
"24487:Prayash Giria,""Better than Tinder, worse than Hinge. This used to be a nicer, simpler app before they tweaked the algorithm to encourage subscriptions. The bees in my hive NEVER turn up in my feed now, even if I get to the point that there's no one left to swipe on. PS - Developer response is an automated bot statement. I have plenty of bees who've liked my profile, so I do not need to 'improve' it. I'll get matches only when the algorithm relents and actually let's these bees into my swipe feed."""
24525:Tommy Peycke,Interface seems decent and I was done with the bots on Tinder.
"24545:Chuck Dude,""Limited swipes in this update? Ehh... Still an ok app, much better than Tinder."""
"24665:Abel Mescua,""I found wonderful people by using it for one week, much better than Tinder. Highly recommended :)"""
24674:Mai Phương Lê Thị,Mình thấy app này khá hay ho. K rườm rà và toxic như Tinder :v match và trò chuyện được kha khá. Nma app này còn khá mới mẻ nên chưa nhìu người dùng nên match được hơi ít. Mn cố gắng kiên nhẫn 1 xíu :v
24680:taylor gray,I'm so tired of every photo I upload getting flagged for no reason other than the stupid AI. I'm going to go back to Tinder and I advise you to just all do the same.
24696:James Henry,A good alternative if you've exhausted Tinder
24823:Plus Minus,Worst Dating App If you want to ask any query or something you won't be able to send message to the customer care of Bumble it always gives a error message More importantly you can't initiate a communication . I WANTED to purchase Premium plan but so lame it is not even allowing me to purchase that plan My money saved because of that error �  Even Tinder is better than this but that is little expensive if we compare Gold plan of Tinder with Premium plaN Still no reply received after email.Worst
24826:Simon Burkhardt,So much more professional than Tinder. Could you please add a setting to change the language of the app instead of using the system language?
24839:SR388,Not any better than Tinder. Avoid.
"24840:William Mercer,""Better than Tinder, better than POF. It's refreshing that girls have to make the move. It's a little different. Lots of nice people who actually make an effort to talk to you."""
"24866:E. Williams,""Honestly didn't see a big difference between this & Tinder. They talk about quality & have all these rules, but in the end, they are the same, except this hijacks your pics. Once uploaded, they won't always let you delete it. I had a pic which CLEARLY showed my face, but b/c I had added hashtags IN THE CORNER-NOT obscuring my face-it wasn't allowed. I've seen main pics of men's profiles w/ no face-sometimes no humans at all-yet, I can't even delete my account w/o uploading a pic 1st. Deleted."""
24883:Noel Góis,This app is pretty cool! Much better than Tinder!
"24962:mahesh bhagwani,""It's not at all worthfu to pay for Membership. It says that's by buying Membership you can increase your chances of getting more matches but it doesn't even Stand on it's own words. Brought one week Membership didn't even got a single match after it. Membership wise it's not at all upto the mark, even Tinder get you few matches after you buy their Membership. Bumble you have to work more hard to beat tinder. App's Interface is very good and accessibility 5 Star for it but Membership is worthles."""
25008:Balaji .D,Equally or more useless than Tinder. Atleast tinder is better.
"25136:Dewayne w,""Finally decided to uninstall - the app is not useful in the slightest for finding a actual relationship. The majority of females who use bumble aren't serious, aren't pro active enough & the rest use it for ego boosts because of covid-19 restrictions or are fake profiles. Either way it's not worth using. The same people who made Tinder run Bumble - that should tell you everything you need to know.... Out of everything I said all they got out of it was fake profiles SMH"""
"25201:David,""Bumble is a good dating app I've used it a few times. I like the fact that photo verification was added, but I feel it should be a requirement before swiping on anyone. The bff section could be improved if you could swipe on the opposite sex to make platonic friends. The biggest turn off is that there aren't as many people on here as Tinder. And the notifications are very annoying when you receive a notifications telling you that you can now swipe but you open the app and can't yet..."""
"25238:Dani Kash,""People are tripping in these reviews like FORREAL! This is a great app! I likevit way better than Tinder. Its fresh and the features are fun. I love the random questions and definately love the profiles and how its set up. Makes getting to know someone interesting before even having a conversation. I personally LOVE the 24 hour to message back feature. If a person is genuinely interested in you, they will MAKE TIME to send a 5 min message out of their day. Thats the best feature. Great App!!!"""
"25259:ranjit pawar,""Good app.. Most profiles are genuine and have pictures unlike Tinder. Would Love if it makes real verified pictures absolutely necessary. However, as of now their verification feature needs lot of work as the camera doesn't detect the person even after several attempts.."""
"25307:Luis Santos,""At first glance it appears vastly superior to Tinder. There's a lot more data on profiles and you can even use it for filtering. But the end result is still the same. 3 matches on day one, but 0 messages. Now it's been 3 days since I installed the spp and there's no more users to swipe. I know you want to empower women and that's great, but until there's a penalty for ghosting, matching without reply or an inactivity indicator, online etiquette will remain dreadful. We all deserve more respect."""
"25383:Shadow Abbott,""Better then Tinder. Get less bots and catfish, and everyone on it is real."""
25390:Zay,Update: still trash and even worse than before. Like I said download Tinder or even Facebook dating. This app and its developers are trash and will steal money from you. Do not download this app. Trash app. Download Tinder instead trust me. Takes awhile but at least the profiles and matches are real. This app sucks. Hands down one of the worst by far! Developers are trash and repetitive and do nothing to make their app a better experience. Wanna blow money for no reason get this app.
25435:Dhairya Thakkar,Better than Tinder.
"25436:Stealth7500,""Tough in a small, conservative market, but isn't too bad. Almost no fake accounts like Tinder or the similar. Women send the first message. Most of the time it's """"Hey,"""" so you're still doing the opening, but occasionally it's much more compelling. Good to shake things up. For paid, you can buy a lifetime of premium, which I haven't seen elsewhere. It's infinite likes, infinite extends, extra premium likes a week. I'd say Bumble still has life in it."""
25490:Chow Kit,Great app! So much better than Tinder! 😝
"25498:Nick Pennington,""What's really amusing is how you get less matches than tinder, and you have to wait twice as long for your """"likes"""" to reset whereas Tinder is 12.

25580:Anonymous,The app sucks. It keeps lagging. Tinder is much much better
"25592:Stephen Kumalo,""Unlike Tinder, I can actually get customer service through an email, and I don't get banned on Bumble without knowing why, or for no apparent reason. Tinder lets its members ban each other with no looking in to anything. That, and I want Bumble to overtake Tinder is why I am giving this a 5 stars."""
25614:Christopher OLoughlin,Much much better than Tinder.
25725:TEXA5 MADE 210,Good overall. You can actually find people unlike Tinder who actually want a relationship or at least go on a date. Tinder its either they ghost you or they don't show up LMAO definitely a good app.
"25845:Sean Boshoff,""The App used to work. Then now everytime I try to use it it'll just be loading forever. Can't read any messages and can't reply to existing questions. Poor service, even worse customer service and my recommendation would be - Tinder, Badoo or anything else. Just avoid the Bumble bullsh*t."""
"25866:David ',""With the new restrictions and reduced functionality, Bumble is now effectively the same as Tinder, but with less users and more restrictions. Don't waste your time on this app. No doubt some Analyst has worked out they'll earn increased overall revenue from a smaller amount of guys by doing this, but this is at the expense of the majority of users."""
"25902:Gorden Lamb,""Like most online dating apps I've surveyed, 98% of the girls you find are not exactly high quality. I, too, reached the bottom of the barrel pretty quickly. Glad I didn't pay for more than a day! Already cancelled the recurring payments. (And just how is this any different from a handicapped version of Tinder? The only """"feature"""" is the guys' inability to msg! Sooo innovative, Whitney.)"""
26075:Tiffany Cheng,Not a great user interface and the app is trying more and more to copycat Tinder's features. The user base is awkward guys that have a palpable and severe fear of rejection.
"26093:Colin Briggs,""Its ok, real profiles for a change which is a good start. They took out all the little things that made this different and turned it into a more expensive Tinder with less features. £35 for 1 month of premium. 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Update: you're also now limited to the amount of folk you can swipe on in a day, unless of course you upgrade to premium. An absolute rip off and reduced down to 1 star. If i could vote 0 stars i would, purely for being complete money grabbers."""
26120:Tomas,So much potential but letting it down with the filtering bugs. Already raised few technical tickets about broken filtering criterias. But they don't seem to do any updates to an app yet. I think Bumble is better than Tinder as it allows more filters to apply to the profiles and you can actually fill those details on your profile as well. But the end result is not good if filters are broken. Useless notifications are also annoying - when they tell you to check your profile but profile is blank.
"26168:Jackson Gable,""Highly recommend! Bumble has a great user interface, is easy & fun to use, and has great people! I recommend it over any other dating app. It's easily my favorite, and I'll choose it any day over Tinder, OKCupid, you name it. The free features are sleek, and if you wanna go for either of the paid tiers (Boost & Premium), their features are excellent, and very reasonably priced."""
26206:qeylIS Morgenstern,Same deal as Tinder - everyone is casual but doesn't want to admit it. Glad I never met anyone from this platform.
"26228:Mark Shaw,""Why do apps like Bumble and Tinder require FB sign in?? Whom I wish to meet and date has sod all to do with FB. I find this requirement ridiculous and objectionable! Uninstalled, June 21, 2017. Even after 4 years, reading through the reviews here, I still see you insist on using Twitter and FB — two of the most notorious, social media apps on the planet. Not everyone uses these disgraceful, crooked platforms. So why do insist on this ridiculous premise??"""
26272:ArticruciA Williams,I am an attractive and over 6ft male who can't get any matches. Your app is terrible and a scam. Tinder is better.
"26300:Alexander Laurence,""Bumble used to be the best dating app, which actually surpassed Tinder. But their reporting system is a complete joke. If someone reports you on a partner platform (i.e. Badoo) then your account gets completely blocked from Bumble too with no chance of appeal or hearing from your side. If you try emailing or contacting support, they just tell you to refer to the rules without any sympathy. I used to defend Bumble as a paying customer, but I can no longer be a supporter let alone a customer of this atrocious app. Be warned."""
26307:Paul Hill,Became money hungry like Tinder...

"26458:Sam Joshi,""Worst app ever , please.dont install it First of all this app does a fake advertisement so that you will buy one of it's plan. You will get a pop frequently to buy the beeline so that you can see who has liked you and also it shoes some pixelated image which makes you think that you are liked by some people but actually you are not. The moment you will buy the plan and go to the liked section you will find it's empty. Tinder is better than this app atleast it has genuine people not bots."""
"26482:Dave J,""Money wise it's like Tinder, it costs you money to super like, it costs you money to set up filters, it costs you money to recall a false swipe, everything costs you.

It says I have a like, I check, nobody. Not the first time. Notifications off, continues, then I'll leave one star and uninstall."""
26527:Milan Shah,Every other dating app I have I get matches. This app is either dead or the algorithm is never even showing my profile. I usually use up all my swipes for the day because it's said to increase your chance of being shown... but still nothing. Tinder and hinge are better.
"26559:Sam N,""Lousy that you not only get fake notifications for likes and potential matches, but have to pay to see people who like you AND put yourself in the spotlight. It's pretty ironic that this app touts itself as """"women making the first move"""" and other faux-progressive nonsense when Hinge at least let's YOU SEE who likes you and stuff. This app is trash and takes advantage of lonely women in the guise of being """"woman friendly"""". May as well be on the same tier as Tinder, which is absolute trash."""

Easiest way would be increasing your distance but how many people are willing to drive more than 80km to meet someone? I'll change my review if it gets fixed"""

One left, one right with a match and then I'm out for the day and have to wait 24hrs? Seems a bit restrictive. I don't want to have to use other apps because this one only gives me a few swipes.

If a women is overflowing with matches , she is only going to respond to 9's and 10's. There's a reason Bumble rating is the same as Tinder or POF"""
27293:Mriganka Das,Best app ever. So user friendly and wholesome. Tinder can only dream

"27442:Paula Moses,""Literally the only difference from Tinder is women message first. Which means nothing when majority of matches are from serial right swipers who never reply.

27630:Muhammad Musaab,Okay they made Premium WAAAY better. It's actually worth it now. The boost features are finally included. Also the new interest feature is great. Good work Bumble Team. Updated from 1-star to 4-stars. You guys beat Hinge in best bang for buck. **Previous Review**: Marginally better than Tinder. Premium subscription lacks features.

Just another sad demonstration of some out-of-touch board of directors ruining a good thing by trying to extract every penny out of the apps patrons. They sure make a big deal out of trying to distinguish themselves from Tinder while looking more and more just like it.
28200:Peter Isaacs,Better than Tinder
28222:Ken Hendricks,Better than Tinder but the subscription cost toi expensive. You'll find more real girls in here compared to Tinder. Do download and find yourself a meaning to love 😉
"28229:Mihály Lőrincz,""Way better than Tinder, less time wasted."""
"28366:Joshua Elliott,""Bumble is just a digital pimp! It's the worst... Get tinder. Don't pay for their boosts, it's a racket. Tinder might be shallow and full of catfish but at least you don't suffer through a sea of fake profiles under a veil of disingenuous placation. ** Anyone working at Bum-mer-ble, I'm talking to you! You have the perfect position in a new and profound market, stop squandering it. An accurate representation of your service is 100x more endearing than the hot-rod-red vernier of recycled profiles"""
28432:Radu Nicoara,Really cool app. It has a numver of features on top of Tinder.
"28500:Alex K,""Next to useless without paying for premium. The 'women have to message first' feature is it's selling point, I can understand that. But matches expiring in 24 hours serves no purpose except to detract from the already subpar experience of this dating app compared to others like it. The profile UI is better than Tinder, but other than that Tinder is better in every way."""
28508:AAA AAA,1. Girls don't get to know initially that they are supposed to text first and instead they wait for guys to text them. 2. Many potential matches are missed due to the 24 hours time limit which is a wrong thing. 3. The special like button must be free at least once or twice a day. Tinder is much better in these regards.
"28527:Nathan Barash,""Had the same number of matches for days now. Only way I'm seeing these matches is if I pay for Beeline, huh? Their algorithm is too unfriendly and anti-consumer. I'll hop over to Tinder."""
"28667:James Kirchgassner,""My profiles on Tinder and Bumble are identical. Pictures, bio, everything. I have 32 matches on Tinder at time of writing. Bumble? One. I'm convinced that Bumble's algorithm is designed to prevent you from seeing people who've liked you and vice versa, unless you shell out money for an overpriced subscription that doesn't even include half of the available paid features. At this point I just swipe to look at people when bored and don't expect anything out of it."""
"28670:Thomas Burgess,""Great app! A lot less time wasting than on Tinder. Women message first - a good idea, I think. Your dating preferences / situation is displayed (eg has kids, looking for something serious/casual, etc). Would be 5 stars if there wasn't an issue where I don't receive notifications for messages."""
"28680:Dallas Wales,""Have had far more luck with Tinder, even for the categories Bumble claims to be about."""
"28725:Martin Pilkington,""Basically Tinder but women contact you first. However you only get to swipe through people every 48hours, or when it feels like letting you. Dunno why, but it's a stupid feature. Just reset it at 12am everyday? I last used 2 days ago, still can't use. I'm removing a star and deleting. All these apps are the same."""
"28756:Guy den Blanken,""Bumble used to be (2+ years ago) an app that really tried hard at being better; with competition like Tinder, it's not that hard to be better. It had really strong features that made it by far the more reliable dating app. And they pissed it all away, turning it into nothing more than a yellow tinder clone. Sad really when all features slowly but surely get locked behind pay walls; even though these used to be free. And even the features that are left have gone down hill. Really just sad."""
"28896:Priit Kaasik,""I find the app to be better than Tinder, because it's easier to provide information about yourself and I find that it's better when the ladies can initiate the conversation. The only downside is the relatively low userbase."""
"28921:Ondra Kosik,""Turns out you it seems you have to pay to get to 100% completion, as a male. Now I have seen the UI from female user side, and there are no clear incentives for women to msg first. 'Ladies first'? Is that it? Such a valuation on IPO and that's the revolutionary spin on dating? Also, the swipe UI itself - you need to drag your finger across the whole width of screen to action the swipe. My finger is noticeably tired compared to Tinder - it's way more sensitive there & swipes are faster"""
"28948:Chris Couture,""I've been on a lot of dating sights and I'll be straight forward, this app seems to be full of people swiping to waste time in this day in age instead of trying to meet an actual match. I'd choose Hinge before Tinder but bumble comes in hard last."""
"28965:Kshitij Rahatekar,""Bumble is soo much better than Tinder in terms of getting matches, but it has its own glitches. A lot of times I don't get notified about new messages, new messages don't pop up instantly after I open the app, it shows you are offline even when the internet is on. Overall it's a good app."""
29056:Mark Fisher,It's about what you'd expect. However what made me decide to write this review is that they want you to pay $25 a month to see the people who have liked you. A feature offered for $15 by Tinder (that's also a bonkers price though.) That's absurd.
"29150:Mr Wasteed,""I hate bumble. Unless you are in a city, save yourself and use something else. Edit1:Additionally, if you look at the profile prompts, it is very ideologically driven questions and default answers. Edit 2:So I joined after 2 years and it still is the worst experience. It seems that this is same as Tinder but as only girls can initiate a convo, guys have even worse experience with it. Idk how a paid account fares but regular is horrible experience."""
"29249:Zandrah UK Business,""Useless. I have a legitimate phone number from a different country to where I am located. Even though there is a list of other countries to use, the app won't accept it and I choose not to log in with Facebook anywhere. Reply to developer: will they take SIX WEEKS to reply to me too? Don't worry, OKCupid and Tinder worked straight away."""
29273:Robert Clark,This app is stupid. Go download Tinder
29282:Prajay Meshram,They are quiet good profiles in Bumble but they seem fake cause I got no matches using it for past 6months now ...and they want me to pay for unlimited likes . Tinder is better
29329:Shivam Bulsara,I bought Bumble Boost. I thought I would get a few superlikes daily for free. It costs 450₹ and no extra features! Tinder offers much more for what it charges you. I want my money back but unfortunately there is no way.
29512:Alex Cazares,Tinder banned me so this is my alternative
29519:Jimmy Gursh,Tried THIS app for a 3rd time now and literally no matches. Tinder and Hinge are far better platforms with much more success
"29728:Vinay Wadhwa,""I used to love this app but slowly it's becoming like all other dating apps. Everything good about it has been now changed to match it with Tinder. Back Swipe, Superlike, 2 advanced filters, Everything is paid now. 😑"""
"29839:Jahan M,""Great app. But lately most who joined recently dont even fill up full Bio which makes again not safe for women. Definitely, there is option not to swipe. But yeah most depends from users. Its just photos or just name. Dont turn into another Tinder nd use for hook ups please (message for men). Otherwise, its very female friendly nd 1st move from a girl then a man can message."""
29938:Philip John,It was good until they charged for using ANY fillets other than location and age. Now no different from Tinder but with fewer people.
"29965:Chris Shawn,""A well laid out app, appearance wise, works smoothly, no hiccups. Now to the actual issues: Way too many inactive profiles being shown, very expensive premium features that aren't worth the price at all, if you don't utilize their premium features at all, they literally hide your matches. Several times I had to pay 2.99 to see 2 matches in my queue that were never shown to me, matches that were less than 15 miles away and my filters are maxed out. Tinder, blk and hinge are much better apps."""
29971:Christian Tschoepe,I love it! After 2 years this app has gotten so much better and I highly recommend it over Tinder or Hinge
"29999:Paul Robinson,""They just changed it so you can't filter any matches, other than by age and distance, unless you pay. No better than Tinder for guys now. Bye bye Bumble."""
30003:Lee Clark,Used to be good but over time it's changed to be more and more like Tinder
"30094:julian saunders,""good app. I don't think the 24 hours limit for women to message is very good, at first it seems great, but then you realise most women only message because of the limit, not because they really want to meet you. So men end up talking to more time wasters than on Tinder. One improvement I can think of is to make the message box larger when you are writing a long message although it could be a limitation of the operating system"""
30175:Alex Kaiser,Overall good experience on bumble. Better than Tinder with less app crashes and interruptions.
30226:Ewen Campbell,Worst dating app out there. Male users cant message their matches (what's the point in matching?) and if they don't message first then they expire after 24 hours. Don't waste your time. Tinder or hinge are better if you actually want to talk to anyone.
30274:MINNESOTA,This App sucks its a run off of Tinder. The CEO sued Tinder thats how she got all her money. She should be sued for copying Tinder. Way to many ADs and ghost fake accounts. Deleted the app.
"30457:Agatha Parlak,""So far, my favorite dating app. The guys seems to be more genuine. Haven't run into any of the standard scammers plaguing POF and Tinder."""
30480:Abe Faison,Better than Tinder but not as good as hinge
30488:Vishal CG,Better than Tinder and all other dating apps!!!!
30522:C C,Tinder and Grindr are better
"30573:Mar Bea,""Not as good as Hinge, but vastly better than Tinder. Same pics got me roughly 10:3:1 ratio of quality matches (Hinge:Bumble:Tinder)"""
"30602:Rupert Love,""better than Tinder, but it needs a dark mode to reduce eyestrain for those of us who are neurodiverse (and those who use screens a lot, which is everyone now). Come on, it's 2020. Edit: come on, it's 2021."""
30742:Hashmi Gor,Not great. Most ppl do not reply and it seems to have taken over from Tinder
"30803:A Google user,""Like Tinder, Bumble has clearly cashed in the trust of their users for short-term revenue. You'll get matches the first 24 hours or so, then never again. If you know anything about psychology, this is the same hook drug dealers use to get you. I hope your stocls get trashed, and your higher-uos lose billions, including their golden parachutes. Maybe after they'll need to work an honest job."""
"30842:Alex,""It's Tinder in a yellow color scheme where the woman has to contact you first. If you didn't have luck with Tinder, you're not really going to have any luck with this app either."""
"30846:Paul Roe,""An amazingly better app than tinder and OKC! I've had more real connections in less than a week on bumble than I have in a year on both the others totaled. And so far, no scammers, which neither Tinder nor OKC seem to care about."""
30866:Kimberly Lambert,Bumble is great. I found a lot of very nice men and I even secured a relationship. This app is easy to use and is much better than Tinder. Good luck and happy swiping!
"30947:Jim Patterson,""HUGE PRIVACY CONCERN: This app now lists where you work (from Facebook) and there's apparently no way to block it! It also sends you nonsense notifications all day long just to get you to login, it's a copy of Tinder with one additional feature."""
"31064:luca salvador,""Easy to operate, Simple but elegant layout, Several bonus features, Covid friendly, and when you actually use the app as intended you get a few matches every day and thats always a confidence boost. Plus I can't use Tinder."""
31230:Raghav Soni,Difference between Tinder and bumble was that you can't keep swiping on Tinder but you could on bumble but this update really sucks change your name or delete the same
"31253:Daniel,""The idea of the app makes sense on paper but in practice it does not work. Well, if you're not hot, this app isn't for you. This app is designed to alienate the """"average joe"""" and give the """"hot guy"""" the advantage. All dating apps are inherently superficial but this one more so than others. If you are average looking, do not expect to get many matches and if you do get any matches, do expect them to expire. You'll have better luck on Tinder or Hinge if you are looking to connect with someone."""
31294:jasmine l,Ban people for being transphobic. Tinder is better anyway. Freedom of choice you agenda based idiots.
"31411:Kristina Woods,""I literally hate this app. The """"Women Message First"""" gimmick is neat, but it ultimately makes it to where you have less people to talk to you if they forget to message you. The UI is ugly and whoever designed it should feel bad. The only reason I still use it is because I'm banned from Tinder"""
"31435:Stephen Renz,""It's just a copy of Tinder but women make the first move, which means no moves are made lol. I'll stick with Tinder so that I can send messages."""
31509:David Linton,Really very disappointing! After several months of paid sub Tinder and Hinge much better! I did contact and not very helpful at all
"31550:James Pavez,""It's good, set up an account during lockdown, also with Tinder and POF, Bumble is definitely for people who aren't time wasters, I'd recommend it as a first port of call for people who want to connect. 5 stars from me. Good luck everyone, happy trails!"""
"31585:Oscar Herrera,""Awful, THE WORST This is a terrible app, I went in expecting something like Tinder easy learn and use - strait forward to use. Its honestly a scam it offers you a one day option of like 2.99 to see who've you matched with. But you have to read the fine print it charges you that like EVERY DAY. I go to Walmart to buy stuff and to my surprise I don't have any money. This app isn't worth it at all."""
"31634:Caitlyn Gilchrist,""The app is nice, but I find that when I try to make an account/redownload it, my account gets deleted/I'm blocked from the app. Im open about being a sex worker, but dont use the app to promote or share links. It makes me wonder if that has something to do with it. I always verify my account, and I write a nice bio to introduce myself. At the very bottom, like A LOT of users on there, i'll add my IG. I use the app the same way I use Tinder and I have no problems with that account. Disappointing."""
31685:SURAJ KARANJE,This app cares about is making money..i used all premium feature yet I go just 1 match.. on the other hand on Tinder i didn't pay a single buck i got 4 matches in 2 days... Bumble is all about making money..
31768:anthony mainini,No matches in 2 weeks. Tinder at least gets a few matches
"31796:Alpha Zero,""Far better than Tinder Actually let's you add filters to see certain types of people, Actually let's you add new photos to your account, isn't overpriced and most people actually have bios. Still yet to have a strike of good luck and match someone 🤞🏻"""
31936:Adwait kulkarni,Useless app. It's another Tinder with different marketing scheme. I bought 5 coins from its still don't show me that coins. It's scam they are cheating and earning money.
31977:Robert kirk,So far so good.... I like it better than Tinder
32034:Hogan Gammons,Much better than Tinder. More likely to find an actual relationship if thats what you're looking for. Less fake profiles as well.
32039:Joe Cooper,Girls never message me on the app and given I can't message them the app is good for absolutely nothing. Tinder and hinge work far better
"32217:Nik Parbhakar,""Did the same thing as Tinder, no more matches for anyone till we pay the application for boast. Bumble was better when it was new. Now its just a all about business. Disappointing."""
"32312:heathawk noob,""The concept is okay. Compared to Tinder, it's nice in that women have to make the first move. It's happened to me way too often where I get a bunch of matches on Tinder only for them to never want to talk. The issue I tend to see is it is basically the same here you match but they never want to say anything. I'm not sure if it is because women arent aware they need to make the first move or whatever but it ends up being a time waster. But if you are interested in just killing time, then its ok"""
"32347:Brandon B,""Why can you only change your gender twice? It's such a weird choice. Its like they thought about helping out the LGBTQ community but just decided to say """"screw it, we'll only commit halfway to it"""". Other apps like Tinder and OkCupid let you change it however and whenever you want. The Bumble developers need to get with the times"""
32361:Josiah Laturnus,Not receiving any notifications no matter what phone and app notification settings I toggle. Never had this problem before. Much better than Tinder otherwise.
"32404:Adam J,""God awful, bring back the old dating app style. Stop being Tinder 2.0"""
"32561:Siobhan Merle,""*sigh* It's just Tinder masquerading as the safe place for women...at least in LA. Sexual harassment, crotch pictures in messages, predators, and when you report bumble sends a message about """"keeping an eye on"""" them. No one's expecting totally safety on an app but for how much effort bumble puts into its marketing as a platform that puts safety first they really don't do anything, it's just a strategy to lure more women onto another unsafe and predatory platform"""
"32587:Adam Pires,""This is the worst dating app I've used. The idea of letting the woman make the first move is awesome and all, but the app needs to let you swipe and match in the first place to make that happen. App only lets me swipe like once or twice a week unless you upgrade. I get barely any matches and far less on conversation. Right now I have 0 matches to talk to. Better off going with Tinder or Facebook Dating. I've actually been able to match, talk to, and go on dates with women on them."""
32682:Martin C,Most definitely better than Tinder when it comes to dating but DO NOT put your card on file. Wanted to see if it was worth it and it's not. After cancellation they continue to charge my card with no way to unsubscribe. If you're going to invest money go the Tinder route. They offer more for less money and don't steal from you!
"32692:Miss Tania Reid,""They deleted my account and gave me no reason why and never responded to my email! So disappointed. Bumble is no better than Tinder, same thirsty men who will waste women's time if they are looking for a serious relationship."""
32718:Marcio Filho,Horrible app. Treats men like trash. Tinder sucks but that's a paradise compared to this.
"32726:Swapneel Deshpande,""Tinder is still better, Atleast i got response on tinder. There is nothing here, not even location specific"""
32752:InvalidUsername _,Choose between not accounts and paying for boost to get zero interest from other users. I'm not a bad looking guy and I got more interest on Tinder than Bumble .

32870:Will Berb,This app is more friendly and female friendly than scam ridden Tinder. Women make the first move. ❤
32894:Thomas Maegerle,Seem to be more real people here than Tinder. So tired of the bots and scammers there. Still waiting for my first match though.
32953:Cole Kennedy,Bumble is miles above any other dating app that I have used. It's a thousand times better than Tinder.

"33083:Jimmy Tran,""Matches never message you. To the developer who leaves these comments about whether or not my profile is good enough, you are putting the onus on me, the guy who can't say anything. Once you match it's not in my court. """"Hi"""" is simple, easy and effective. Dating apps have forgotten the reason they're around. And that is, to form genuine connections between people. Instead they've gamified people's loneliness for profit. Not just you guys, but OkCupid and Tinder too. Rework it."""
33112:Bhargabh Goswami,Been 2 months. No matches yet. Tinder is giving more matches instead.

33258:Cyndi Cox,Better than Tinder 🤣
"33319:Zach Schistosome,""The fact that it's not: Tinder, Hinge, OkCupid, PoF or any other Match Group™ product puts it head and shoulders above its competition. If only to monopoly-bust, this app should be tried first."""

Cheap tricks I must say."""
"33414:Siptellnet Hollywood Florida,""Bumble create this """"fake match"""" is not real, this women never respond. Bumble is making fool of us. Many """"matches"""" but ladies never make the move.

Tinder more reliable, millions of women around the world."""
"33440:Black,""Has a little bit more of quality users than Tinder or similar. It also has different queues for people looking only for friends or business, so in that regard it is pretty solid. However, swiping more than a single queue every 24 hours requires a pricey subscription."""
"33459:Alon Parag,""Poorly designed app, stay away Bumble is my least used dating app as it simply doesn't display any relevant users. Most of those displayed are at leadtaround 70 km away from my location and there's no distance filter (or any effective one, at least in the free version). Also, in contrary to other apps such as Tinder or OKC, the algorithm doesn't prioritize users that liked you. It doesn't matter if I swipe 50 users consecutively to the right, somehow that like message doesn't becomes a match"""
"33503:Ian S,""Has gone downhill. Trying to make more money, but limiting swipes to 40 and making user wait 24 hours is not even as good as Tinder. No more free daily go back. Everything I preferred about Bumble over Tinder is gone. I would expect this app to go the way of okcupid."""
"33537:Mason Maguire,""Horrible experience. Easily can place Bumble next to Tinder. Inactive accounts, the milage is wrong. I purchased the monthly subscription, it was not worth it. I'm only seeing 10-20 people tops. Half of them are a lot further then 20 miles. Definitely don't recommend."""
33669:Niko here,Hi really love this app way better than Tinder but ever since the latest recent weekly update this past week I dont get notifications anymore from bumble app if someone matches likes or messages me I have to go into the app manually & will see a message notification on the icon at the bottom corner of the screen please fix this!
"33720:Josh Milne,""Always see this app on social media as the best dating app out there, and instead its probably the worst. Been on and off it for about a year, and only ever had 3 matches. But because the girls message 1st, you don't get anything because no girl ever makes the 1st move. It also seems to be that it's just the good looking girls on there, that are out of most lads league, just like Tinder. There's no variety. They're all 10's nothing below, which doesn't make sense for a supposedly top dating app"""
33777:Raunak Chitlangia,Design needs to upgrade. Tinder and hinge are competing
33799:Tkenyon,Worse than Tinder for getting no matches....Algorithms heavly depend on how much you spend - Do not expect to match anyone unless you pay as your profile will be hidden. Pointless
"33818:Zackary Severino,""While not as full of prostitutes as Tinder, it pushes its paid services too much in notifications."""
33865:Alec Dela Losa,Does not compare to Tinder
33881:Paul Cochran,Algorithm seems more fair than Tinder at least.
"33996:Puneet Nagpal,""Why is it so hard for Bumble to showcase one's location correctly. If Tinder, Ola, and Zomato can do it, I am sure your engineers should also be capable enough.. Wrote to your team and got another pre-canned response."""
34051:Ordepnok,A lot more comfortable and versatile than other apps you'll find out there. Definitely deserves as much (if not more) popularity as apps like Tinder.
"34080:Matthew Little,""Callous and cold-hearted refund policy. I was auto-charged a subscription fee on an inactive account for an additional six-month term. I emailed Bumble within hours to tell them it was an error and they simply sent me a message saying the fee was non-refundable. This is an immoral and unforgiving policy and is telling about how the company operates - dishonestly and without regard for users. Truly, I had better experience with Tinder customer service, which says quite a bit about Bumble."""
"34129:The Legend,""Edit: After some thinking, I finally gave in and decided to purchase a subscription. Needless to say, I was impressed. Unlike Tinder, Bumble allows you to learn more about people, and to react to their images more diversely. In addition, I've had an easier time, as a guy, engaging in conversations with matches. My subscription is still in effect so I can't say whether or not it's good without it, but so far, my experience with bumble has been collectively better than every dating app I've tried."""
"34159:Steven Bara,""WARNING!!! They block you without any notice. I suddenly had my valid pictures removed and needed to verify, which I already did. I wasn't able to access my profile anymore even to delete it. So suddenly you do not have any access to your data anymore. This is almost criminal!

"34785:kÄnsen Media,""The concept is interesting. Gave a try if seeing convos could be better than on Tinder but, apparently you have to be a Greek God or someone plenty of hobbies/experiences in the way the matches you want know the most don't let the 24h countdown die off. I'm sorry but i'll keep Tinder where I can blame my unsuccess with some matches because being silent / not initiating chat instead of being swiped right for then not be enough good for a first message in 24h as happened on this app. Cheers."""
"34838:Rose Chisholm,""I can't get laid on Tinder as a woman. The hookers on Tinder report on all the real women as fake. Bumble is much better. The guys are more trusting, too. They are not suspicious like Tinder users."""
"34851:Joe Chessher,""I find Bumble is flawed if you are a guy using the app, because getting a match is meaningless, as you cannot interact unless the woman messages first and in my experience women messaging first is a rarity. Had I not got banned from Tinder, I wouldn't attempt using Bumble and Bumble is not an app I would recommend for guys. If you're a woman, go ahead, you'll probably love it but if you're a guy, probably isn't the app for you."""
"34976:Michael Villegas,""The app funnels you into paying for the app just like Tinder. You'll never see most of your matches. I had 30+ matches for ever at one point because as I swiped right on EVERY person everyday I never marched with anyone. Until I paid for the """"premium"""" that's when I was able to start matching with them. It's ridiculous. I use this as another way to meet people and it'll just funnel you to paying for it."""
"35016:Eleni Andersen,""WAY better than Tinder. Theres more people looking for something serious, and more intelligent and educated people as well. I love the paradigm of women making the first move as well. Suggestion to developer: add more political identity options, i.e. """"left of liberal"""""""
"35017:Andrei Limberea,""1000x better than even Tinder premium or any other dating app contender! Very customizable with results, matches occur quite often and are basically seemless. Great for shy/introvert men seeking someone."""
"35117:Amy Buer,""In Hamburg: This is the only dating app I've found that has men on it who actually want to go on real dates with me. Found a lot of great men here! In Berlin: I write to 100 men. 8 of them write me back. 1 wants to go on a date with me. It's just way, way too much work... On Tinder, interested (really interested) men can write to me first, saving me from writing 92 useless messages. Berlin has rendered Bumble unusable."""
"35192:M P,""A nice and cool app. Close to Tinder, even better regarding the space given to personalize the profile."""
35274:James Smith,So much better than Tinder. If you are a genuine guy then this is the site for you!

"35376:Chris Mitchell,""Could be a good app, but the women almost never respond in time before the 24 hr timer expires. On the off chance you do get a match AND they respond, you are doomed to receive a """"hey"""" opener followed by a few sentences of forced convo and getting ghosted. Matches are much lower chance than Tinder (might have something to do with just the size of the userbase, idk). As a man....save yourself hours of frustration and dont bother with this app."""
"35383:Jorge Tabasco,""Another app that goes for the easy money than for customer's satisfaction. Likes are hidden behind a paywall, they only give 48 hours for matches to start the conversation and charge to give more hours (strangely, all the matches """"forget"""" that they liked you even if they appear as recently active).

Update: Now bumble is hiding all matches. Can only see them by paying. So why bother swiping? So the app seems popular to others. Paying does noting anyway, you match then get no response."""
35422:Max Gringaus,You don't get anything unless you pay. Tinder CEO was right calling the company owner the way he called her. BUMBLE SUCKS!
35454:Ceus,Way better than Tinder !

35915:Sandor Dugalin,I like the format. Way better than Tinder garbage.
"35916:Paul Caridi,""Started off really well, it was basically Tinder for people who are trying to get a relationship.

36008:Ric Cook,So much better than tinder. I am a guy and have had actual responses. Tinder was follow my insta. Here I have been On dates and had fun.
36048:Jane Enright,This app used to be really good but it's now as bad in both functionality and choice of potential matches as Tinder. Real shame.
36056:F Smeltz,It seems to be less spam and fake accounts as Tinder. Really have no complaints other than having to pay to Really get the most out of it. If girls are looking for other girls. Its all guys

Would not waste your time, only thing its better at is keeping bots out."""
36458:Senada Raines,Doesn't really do what it's supposed to. 2017 Tinder could do Bumble's job better than 2020 Bumble. Avoid this dating app.
"36554:Matthew Gilreath,""Pretty good overall. Plenty of nice people. Most folks shy away from someone with a disability but people are butts like that everywhere. It's better than POF and Tinder, so there is that."""
36565:Nikolaus Lulich,Comparable to other leading dating apps. Im a little less hesitant to use Bumble as opposed to Tinder.

36713:Chris Johnson,So far so good much better than Tinder!!
"36738:Seren Christ,""Really poor customer service, I changed my phone number and they didn't even try to help me get my account back. They also """"force"""" you to accept policies you might not agree with, very sad way of doing cheap politics.

"36742:Sam Gardner,""It took a while, and they definitely didn't advertise my profile much after a month, but I found my wonderful girlfriend on it. The crowd is better than on Tinder"""
36844:mirna vm,Where are the men's bios??? All gone after the latest update. If I wanted to swipe left and right from just looking at photos I'd be on Tinder.
36859:Peter,Better than Tinder.
"36921:Person Guyerson,""Woah isn't that crazy, the day I get boost I get matched to three really stunning women that then never message me even when I extend the match to 48 hours. Obvious Botting is incredibly obvious, what is with this app and tinder thinking that matching you with a bot that never says anything will get you to stay and pay the super expensive premium membership costs? Bumble and Tinder deserve the lawsuits that will eventually fall into their laps. Giant waste of time but what's new with dating apps"""
36925:Ant Guest,Great app if I wanted to date someone in Singapore while living in the UK. Better off sticking with Tinder as you have better success off a free account. Yes I know Tinder has its bots but so does all the other dating apps. I got 22 matches in 24 hours on Tinder yet apps like this and Baboo give you rarely any matches without premium.
36931:Martin S,Tinder girls are much better
36954:Jason Batten,Just becoming more like a yellow Tinder with each update :(
36960:Saran Kakarlapudi,Looks decent and definitely better quality users than on Tinder.
"36978:RIICHII RR,""Bumble vs Tinder? No comparison. A POSITIVE supportive MEETING PLACE. Good news is women take the lead here. I like the fact that women who I choose to send a like, or super like, Have control to making the first 'move' Likewise they are able to send me a likehowever after I have acknowledged their ' 'like'.. it's STILL in their control"""
"37067:Ryan C,""A concept that had sincere, good intentions in practice falls short. Most women, on average, still prefer to be approached rather than being required to initiate the conversation. Bumble also has a serious censorship issue as it does not allow pics with firearms or """"bathroom selfies""""...how are either of these dangerous?...Tinder is more of a wildcard with regards to profile variability (i.e. is the profile even real, or a scam/bot), but I've still had more success with it than Bumble."""
"37184:Noah Kowal,""The free version of Tinder is solely designed to crush your soul to get you to buy the premium version. Bumble is a lot better because it makes it so the first girl you see when you open the app is always one who has already liked you, it's pretty great. It probably still sucks if you get no matches but at that point just hit the gym buddy, no app is gonna help you. Plus for whatever reason the girls on Bumble are super into me, I feel like I'm the prettiest girl on prom night."""
37214:Shankar Ravikant,Better than Tinder
"37232:Alexander Akner,""It's way better than a lot of the other apps like Tinder. Fewer users unless you live in the larger cities, but the experience is overall a way better, a lot more serious regarding meet ups and conversing. A much nicer vibe 💙 The critique would be some of the off push notifications and the ease of access swapping between the BFF-section and the relationship-section."""
"37261:Teleken,""I can't believe I didn't download this app sooner! It's amazing. Way better than Tinder. The profile setup is more robust, it has more in-depth filters for getting really picky about who you swipe on, and giving women the burden of making the first move really encourages confidence in them and it's cute. Been smashing hella since I got the app. I recommend it, gentlemen."""
37300:John Leonard,How many people do you think wrote bad reviews because they're just salty? It's a nice app. Better than Tinder for sure.
37365:J T,Bumble makes it optional to verify your account! Would guess about 60-70% of the women on here are inactive. It is Tinder except Women have to message you first. It's literally endless swiping. Good luck guys!
37425:Khan Wali,I recommend bumble as one of the best dating app even far better then Tinder... Bumble rocks..
37454:Robb Medved,I made the mistake of paying for a membership for a day just to go through the 50+ women who liked me but never seemed to pop up in my feed. Now that Bumble knows I'm willing to pay they clearly keep all the matches hidden. I can see them accumulating but if the woman likes me first she will never pop up in my feed. Super shady practice. On the plus side it attracts a classier clientele than Tinder so I cling to hope.
"37455:Carl Fattal,""Like Tinder, but worse. Very limited selection every 36 hours unless you pay. Female empowerement is a marketing hype, not reality. Most women will expect you to start any meaningful conversation. On the plus side, fewer ads than Tinder."""
37470:Elijah S.,No matches whatsoever after the first two weeks. This app is much worse than Tinder in that regard. Other apps work great for me.
"37473:Kiko Santos,""This meant to be a bad copy of Tinder but with 2 main differences: No cheeky or showing too much photos and also 24 annoying hours that you can see the real face of majority the ladies in online dating, overwhelmed of matching guys for a boosting ego collection. Helping more to the one gender frustrating the other? Empowering unsecure people to laugh on the opposite gender? Making feel them safer? Bad built up sexist idea that doesn't make sense and is against equality"""
"37513:Gianpaolo Castagnetti,""Esta nueva actualización es un """"paso atras"""" con respecto a la versión anterior. Sé que quieren tener una interfaz mas parecida a Tinder, pero siento que eso lo convierte más en una copia que en una app única. La antigua interfaz me parecía mil veces más cómoda y mostraba toda la información necesaria. Está nueva interfaz, lamentablemente, no muestra bien algunos datos como: lugar de origen, lugar actual, ubicación, artistas de Spotify (solo muestran dos), entre otras cosas."""
"37526:Bob Sawyer,""Total waste of time. Among other things, this app will bait you with false notifications about matches and messages. I have received dozens of them which tell me I have new likes and messages, and I log on to find it's just luring me in to spend time on the app. On top of that, the user interface is clunky, they want money for features other apps provide for free, and the user base is extremely limited, and most won't message you after liking. Tinder is absolutely superior."""
37568:Chris D,Way better than my experience with Tinder and Zoosk.
"37630:tagilala bori,""It deleted my account because I was trying to sell and buy? There was no previous warning to this, I do not know what I tried to sell or buy, honestly no warning before hand to what I tried to sell or buy, just took my account down, which I find very dumb. Tinder and bumble are the same app, no warning to why they take down the account, doesn't tell you what you did wrong, or how you did it, no wonder no one likes bumble"""
"37648:Craig Short,""It's really no different from any other dating app and offers nothing new. Even if girls are supposed to make the first move the majority of matches will either remove you or ghost you before they even try to get in touch. If you have no luck on Tinder and the like, you won't have luck here."""
"37679:keshav rustagi,""Tinder should take tips from you, on how to make a decent dating application."""
37761:Dylan Sapp,Bumble sucks never even got one match. Tinder worked first day. Nuff said
37796:Taiku Bruno,Better than Tinder
37812:Aaron Nyberg,This app is a shakedown. If I want to see who liked my profile I have to pay like $3 per day? Not even joking when I say it makes Tinder gold look good.
37890:Dhiraj Sonje,Better than Tinder and other dating apps
37894:Jose Maria Franco Gonzalez,Bumble>Tinder. Great app!
"37929:Jamal Jones,""Bumble completly beats Tinder on one count; filters. You can swipe as much as indiscriminately as you like without worrying about matching with an undesirable, such as a single mom. Definitely the better app. 👌🏿"""
38057:Rakesh Rajpurohit,Pathetic app. Tinder is much better. Guys plz don't use it.
"38062:Jordan Williams,""Whoever is claiming that there aren't many women on here is either too picky or needs to do some work on their profiles. I much prefer the women on here as opposed to Tinder, PoF, etc. They're typically classier, better looking, and there are far fewer fake profiles. Also, I love how they have to send the first message. If you're looking for more than just a quick fling, this is the app you should be on."""
38104:Astronomical Reason,The absolute worst dating app. Try Hinge or Tinder. If you don't want to take my word for it look at the numerous 1 star reviews. I promise anything more than a 2 star review is someone paid by Bumble to do it.
"38189:Jacob Delano,""I agree with other reviews the paywall is lame. Also it feels like Tinder with the swiping. I like that Hinge allows you to message people right away. Go download Hinge, forget Bumble."""
38201:Jo You Know,I do not like the updated style of viewing profiles. At least you're not wasting your time for more than a day or two with attractive people collecting dust.... like on Tinder...
38202:Ymani Efunyale,Better than Tinder
38257:Jasmine ferguson,This is definitely better than Tinder!! 10/10
"38320:John Doe,""It works but at the beginning all do I suppose, is kinda like Tinder but maybe a little less casual"""
38513:Joel,Tinder is better.
38571:Mark Holloway,Price and Features make this the best dating app. Tinder is Walmart. Bumble is Target.
"38613:Cameron Norris,""This app used to be ok, but recent changes have made the experience just as bad as Tinder. Bring back having 3 backtracks a day and bring back the less limiting number of swipes. I've gone on a date with one person from this app, but in general absolutely nothing happens. I get maybe 1 match every week or 2, and most matches I get never say anything. The engagement here is probably better than Tinder, but the fact they've actively made the app worse as a cash grab merits this review."""
"38621:David Alexander,""I think the central premise of this app needs some rethinking. I'm all for points of difference, but not when they force men and women to act contrary to their natural instincts. Thanks Bumble for replying. I'm not on social media. If I were you, to increase market share in smaller countries (where Tinder is dominant), I'd adopt a more flexible approach. Perhaps offer well crafted canned openers for women, or give women the option to select specific guys that they can permit to message first."""
"38669:Mike V,""For some perspective, I've had my profile reviewed a number of times and have been told it's a great profile with attractive photos of an attractive person. Even with having a premium account and using spotlight and swiping for the full 30 minutes, I get about a 10th the matches on Bumble that I get on Tinder. As a guy, Bumble is pretty awful, regardless of how attractive you are. Tip: if you use Bumble, don't waste your money on anything in the app. They are 100% not worth it."""
38728:Bishal Das,Just a beautiful pile of garbage. Tried to imitate Tinder but couldn't achieve even half of it. All you'll see are money-making tricks and tactics cleverly set up and designed by the developers to loot the users while they just sit all day with their lazy butt. I have a question for all the users out there. Did you even meet and get to marry somebody through this app? Or are you just out there wasting your hard earned money so as to satisfy your sadistic souls. One mid-finger is not enough
"38752:J Chandler,""A far cry from how the app started out. Less emphasis on bio, more on pictures. The new prompts, UI/layout & simplified stat details seem more Tinder-esque which likely means a shift in the demographic they're aiming for."""
"38818:Vedansh Chauhan,""I really love Bumble. It's such a straight forward, yet comprehensive app having such a simple interface. It definitely has a much friendlier UI than Tinder etc. . Please developers, never mess with the app UI. It's perfect. Dark mode is all I'm waiting for."""
"38870:Katherine K,""Removed free features, so bummed no more free backtracking, Bumble is slowly turning into dreaded Tinder. Also the newest update makes the profile way too hard to see, busy, info spread out... delete the update and bring back backtrack!!!"""
"38915:Daniel Pérez,""My first day I got 3 matches. 1 said hi and never replied again, the other 2 never talked to me. Then 0 matches in like 3 weeks. Funny thing is the notifications saying I miss 100% of my matches, even after testing it and swiping right at 100% of the girls. So yeah it hides your profile and the trolls you with notification. Same problem as Tinder, what is my incentive to pay Premium if this is my initial experience ? Even without paying, it's a waste of time."""
"38926:Roger Cameron,""Best dating app on the market currently. Tinder microtransacts everyone just to be seen. But, girls don't like boys -- girls like cars and money."""
39027:Umang Malhotra,No matches for boysm This another Tinder like app also sucks for guys.
"39128:Natalie Nugent,""I personally think this app is bs, because they deleted my account as fake and said I've been reported. Not even giving me a chance to prove I'm real or make a new one! So now I can never use this app when I am very real. I wasn't swearing or being sexual on my profile. Obv someone reported me for whatever reason they saw fit, but I think that's pretty ridiculous that I can NEVER make an account again. On facebook you lose it for a day or so. I've never had this happen. Tinder or hinge for me."""
"39172:Victor Rodriguez,""The app's a lot like Tinder, in that you have a terrible chance of getting matches. To increase your chances, it also seems like you have to buy some micro-transactions. It's really a waste of time."""
"39183:Null Nada,""BFF Needs updating! """"BFF"""" is not sex-orientation based as Bumble believes. I only get male matches with the majority being gay. Additionally & by location, outdoorsy gay men are common here so a filter on sexuality is recommended. I prefer straight males to increase chances of finding outdoorsy dudes. Also, no date time stamp like Tinder. I would like to know when the message was sent so I can properly respond. BFF Could be Awesome if these 3 upgrades are added."""
"39200:Tom Heaton,""Like Tinder but worse, plus a constant stream of garbage articles"""
"39213:Savage Investor,""This app was a pretty draining and demoralizing experience to say the least. You have to pay for all the basic features, matches are mediocre at best or just women looking for validation. Between this app and Tinder you are watching a race to the lowest rating and right now bumble is winning. Like all washout apps they start off awesome then cave to greed by forcing you to pay because they secretly shadow ban you. Stay away."""
"39238:Nicoli Ames,""Notifications for new messages are inconsistent, which causes me to unintentionally ignore people. Also, the main message window (where it shows all people that you are messaging) is often out of sync with the messages (shows I have unread when I don't, or shows I have nothing new when I do!). I like the service better than Tinder, but Tinder seems to be better software behind the scenes."""
"39274:Mike Verhoeven,""Grandioos concept. Na dating apps als Tinder waar veeleisende dames zitten die van alles verwachten vanuit de mannen en zelf niets doen, is een app waar de dames de eerste stap moeten zetten een hepe verfrissing. Jammer dat diezelfde dames van Tinder e.d. ook hierheen komen en dan vervolgens na een match helemaal niets zeggen."""
"39297:jessica spattz,""Honestly it's just not great. Very limited for what you can do. Tinder is reasonably priced but this app charges 4$ a day to see who likes you. Very strict on what pictures you can include. No mirror selfies?? Took down a couple that were just normal pictures as well. Also women HAVE to say the first thing, and the guy has 24 hours to respond or the match is deleted. Just a lot of stress for no reason?? There are a few good things about the about it but would not recommend."""
39345:Fernando Javier González Briones,Mejor que Tinder por mucho... Excelente UI/UX
39380:Kamatoka,Hate The New Update! Its now so much harder to use and navigate. Bumble is now copying Tinder with the click to the side to get to next photo. Profiles flowed much better when you could scroll UP and DOWN a profile and made it unique as well which is why Bumble use to be my preferred option. Now its hard to see people's information and stats. Can no longer see starsigns either. Bring back the old layout Bumble. Don't fix what isn't broken!!
39446:Cosmic Vagrant,A million times better than Tinder
39475:Jeff,The new format of this app (android phone) is terrible. Each version keeps getting worse. Neither push nor email notifications working. The Tinder format is so much better. Now there seems to be much lower numbers of users.
39494:Dave Beverley,Now lower rated then Tinder. Tells you everything you need to know in the direction this app has gone. Used to be great. Had a never ending stream of likes/matches on an account last year. Now it can be days without my profile being shown to a single person.
"39496:Celine Hadrysiak,""Works a bit better than Tinder I like the new prompts feature too, helps write a better profile 👍"""
39536:Emerson Smith,Bumble is going down hill. I applaud it for being different from Tinder by making women start conversations but all its proven is that women are bad at starting conversations. Multiple features that used to be free now cost money (and a lot of money too). And just because women message first doesnt mean that your matches will be any more successful. There needs to be an unmatch because I was ghosted feature.
"39542:logan68k,""Horrible, god-awful app. Haven't had a match in months. I used to think this was better then Tinder... and for a while it was. Now they both suck. Dating apps don't care about you. They care about money. They don't even try to hide it anymore. Use it for a few weeks while they give you a new user boost. After that? Uninstall it and don't waste your time..."""
"39558:Rebecca Leijen,""Ive always liked this app but i dont like the new layout. Its a bit awkward to use and its like the Tinder layout. Bumble isnt Tinder, Bumble is unique and it was nice to be different from Tinder. �"""""

"39577:Kale,""Customer support is a polite brick wall. They may remove a photo weather or not it breaks the rules, and no amount of explaining why they're wrong, will change their flawed viewpoint.

"39584:Alextremmetal,""I hope you like the number 0 cause it's how many match your gonna get with this app, no jokes. 😂 Over 9 month I got 4 match, only once a girl talked to me! Meanwhile I got 50 match on Tinder and a couples of dates."""
39649:Cristian L,It's easier to get a match on Tinder. I think that's enough said.
"39655:Pierrick Bourgeat,""The """"want/have children"""" filter was the one feature that really made Bumble stand out compared to Tinder, as this is quite important when looking for a future partner. Now that this feature is gone, with no warning or reasons given, I don't see any reasons to keep using it."""
"39663:Kory Glover,""Downloaded Bumble, Tinder and Hinge at the same time a couple weeks ago. Since then: Tinder (9 matches), Hinge (8 matches & 2 likes) and Bumble... absolutely nothing. Literally the worst dating app available. Do not waste your time. Anything else is better"""
"39687:Alex Martinez,""Used to be a better app than Tinder. But now it seems they want to be Tinder by limiting the amount of swipes you have so you can pay. I get it, it's business. But most business with this train of thought tend to fail. I think it is going in that direction."""
"39760:Calogero Damanti,""Much better than Tinder, way easier to meet people with similar expectations thanks to more in depth profiles."""
39800:Jesse Morrell,Better than Tinder
"39807:Rodrigo Costa,""The competition has gotten real vs Tinder, you've ruined the app 😂 your're actually more expensive than Tinder and considering they've copied some of your functions which renders this app now kind of useless and Tinders price although expensive but they are more reasonable than yours."""
39835:Wyatt Farrar,This is by far the best dating app I've used. It's better than Tinder and Hinge imo
39901:Jacob Miller,I've had a lot of good experiences from this app. Generally more mentally mature and confident users. The systems that differentiate it from Tinder are really worth while. Would like read receipts.
"39923:John Gunner,""Echt tolle App, finde sie besser als Tinder. Das Konzept lockt auch sehr viele authentische Frauen an."""
"39951:Ben Hecht,""This app USED to be a good alternative to Tinder. It didn't require you to pay and was a fresh idea to dating apps. Now it's EXACTLY like Tinder in that you need to pay to get anything out of it. It'll make you wait an entire day after you run out of matches, and then only let you swipe on a handful of people before stopping you again."""
"40005:Nisim Simsolo,""So now we need to pay in order to """"see the bee who's already liked me in my Beeline""""? Are you for real? maybe you want me to pay also for being able to swipe? while OKCupid and Tinder are more greddy than ever, you can be more friendly by reducing paywalls (and not adding new ones) and help us to find match during COVID19 time."""
40006:Dennis Tyler-St Clair,Not very friendly for LGBT guys. Had this app for a whole month and not one match. With Tinder I get a new match or two every week. Tinder is much better for LGBT guys
"40083:James Napier,""Its like tinder but the girl has to text first, but yet people treat it like tinder, so the guy is supposed to text first. The app very clearly doesn't make it obvious that the hirl has to text first, of the many matches Ive gotten none actually sent anything, and my experience with Tinder shows that girls want the guy to text first, its a good idea, just nobody seems to actually want to go through with it"""
"40203:Diego Villagran,""I just deducted a star because it was a promising app, but is going in the wrong direction trying to look like Tinder...now you can't focus on pics, which was a nice feature in previous versions."""
40207:Elliot Koh,Better than Tinder. More engaging it feels. Doesn't have buggy issues Tinder had. More informative profiles and cleaner UI.
"40222:Josh M,""Garbage app, garbage company. EDIT: since they got their panties in a bunch over my review (no hard feelings, that's just what you're paid for isn't it?), I'll explain exactly why. Bumble exploits addiction behavior like many apps. They have not advanced as far as Tinder when it comes to that. But the really damning thing is the negative impact it has on gender relations, the dehumanizing, objectifying meat market nature of swiping. Woke marketing wont change that. EDIT: lol struck a nerve"""
"40226:Stephen Pacheco,""So I've used Tinder, Hinge and Bumble and out of the three Bumble is by far the worse. I love the concept that girls get to message first and there's prompts you get to write down but i never get matches. I'm lucky if I maybe get a match a week which is uncommon compared to other dating apps. Also the pricing for premium is outrages compared to other apps. Honestly I recommend Hinge over Bumble. I've had had much better experience with it."""
"40228:Edgar Cabrales,""App is rigged. Bot matches. Yes it's free to use, but the bot matches are for you to just buy the options and get no where with it once you look at your matches. . . UPDATE: Now it's a 1 star. They officially got rid of the one free feature that was good and that was the backtrack option. Now they want to charge you like Tinder does. I was done with Tinder due to that. UPDATE....No you won't."""
40254:zee nkosi,Way better than Tinder.
"40320:Ray Big,""I really used to like this app till the recent update. As a guy, the conversations I had with women were amazing. People actually read your profile. Right now, this has become a very similar experience to Tinder. Where I used to get profound first texts, I know get 'hey' all the time because no one reads your profile anymore, and I can't be bother to answer. Changing it back would be a win. This way you set yourself apart from Tinder. Quality over quantity. This will grow."""
40343:Graham Kree,I didn't think any app could be worse than Tinder. Enter Bumble.
"40382:Brandon Buckles,""The app is broken. It will only connect to the internet 50% of the time. No other apps on my phone have this issue. These issues are with an expensive paid subscription, so this app doesn't deserve more than 1 star until they get that fixed. As for when it works.. meh. There's little difference between this and say..Hinge or Tinder. Less trash advertising and scammers than Tinder but less effective than Hinge."""
40427:Dios De Hueco Mundo,I haven't gotten any matches yet but that's mostly an issue on my part... The free version of this app limits the amounts of swipes but that limit is considerably high. You could look through profiles (of very attractive girls I might add) for an hour before you reach that threshold. The only thing that bothers me is that you have to base your opinion on a person's appearance and occasionally a couple words - much like Tinder - which just doesn't make it easier for me to make a decent decision.
"40429:Shivani Deo,""The new interface sucks!!!! I used to like reading about the person AND going through their pictures. Now it's just a trashy copy of Tinder which focuses only on people's photos and, if you're patient enough (which most people aren't), the matter comes last. No one takes the effort to write a good bio because, hey, screw depth. Throughouly disappointed with the new look."""
"40518:Bernard J,""Bumble a solid app. Can also appreciate its 1 day subscription option. More apps should do this idea its really convenient. And doesnt burn your wallet nearly as badly as say, Tinder's asking price. However recently has been running little more slowly. Which is getting annoying. Could use a fix."""
40522:derek richards,Limiting the amount of swipes was the last straw. Tinder is once again the superior dating app.
40528:Steven Imas,Tinder is better
40563:Ben McCarty,A downright sexist app designed to promote inequality in favour of women throughout the complete UX. Plus most dates I've met were using Tinder among other dating apps anyway!
"40572:Riley Ryan,""App imposed a limit on the number of people you can swipe on and made you pay for the undo feature, seemingly to copy the monetization scheme of Tinder. You're better off not using this one, Tinder's selection of people is better. Bumble used to have the advantage of endless swiping and the ability to undo a left swipe, but now there's no reason to choose it over the more popular alternative."""
"40608:Darsh Parekh,""The last update has been a major turndown. The profiles don't load anymore. Half the time the app shows """"you're using bumble offline"""". Scroll down to know more was something different that made bumble stand out with competition. Now it's just Tinder with a different skin. Disappointed."""
40767:Nefnate,Far better than Tinder
40837:Dirk E.,Boring app. Notifications which make you discover sealed features because you're on the unpaid plan. Tinder is still much more fun!
40843:Shah Khan,The latest update just ruined the entire experience. It was one of the most easiest app to use and with the latest version we're forced to go thru all the screens. Talk about taking something not broken and then purposely breaking it in the name of improvement. You guys should fire your design team! Stop trying to be like Tinder!
"40889:Chinmay Desai,""This is the best and genuine app I've ever come across. Wonderful platform. No Fake like Tinder, Etc. I don't know why people do mistakes of swiping left accidentally then call this app bad because they charge you for rewind, Even Tinder Does Charge for Reverse but Tinder is Extremely Expensive just like TrulyMadly, OKCupid, Wee, etc no real profile, no calling facility, bad UI."""
40982:Ahmed ElAssy,Good app in terms of functionality. But it somehow feels 'Designed' to give the illusion that there are tons of people out there with very little chance of getting a match. Same as Tinder
41008:Paddy Kerley,I love how in the middle of a pandemic they removed the ability to see how far away someone is... That's pretty essential if you plan on following your local gov's guidelines... Also the new UI... Garbage... It's basically rubbish Tinder with some text stuck at the end...
"41029:Sanjay Sunder,""Why did you have to roll out that ugly new interface! Used to love the app. Stop being Tinder, you were really good at being Bumble."""
"41136:Dave Johnson,""I used to think the app was tops, but man, its gotten bad. don't waste your time. even (gasp) Tinder is better these days"""
"41141:Nikolaus Weiss,""The new update to the layout, completely ruined the app. Now all the text is awkwardly crammed at the end of the profile, and nothing separates Bumble from Tinder anymore, as the focus is entirely on the pictures now."""
41217:Adam Larson,Better than Tinder but doesn't match as well as Hinge
"41221:Nick Snicklefritz,""This app was probably close to 5 stars last week, my only gripe was that not enough people use bumble. I just logged in and noticed there's been a UI update that completely ruined this app, and so I will be deleting my account and bumble itself. Why did you decide you needed to be more like Tinder? The attraction of Bumble was that it was completely different from anything else, now they've turned it into another copy/paste dating app."""
"41281:A Google user,""i like the look and feel of this app. So much better than Tinder. However, it doesn't seem like that many people are on it, because I only get about 2 or 3 options per day."""
41289:Wilmer Pedroso,...literally why would you do this to your app interface. The scroll made profiles look dynamic and interesting. Now it's just another Tinder. What a horrible update
41386:Josue Godoy,Pretty awesome! Way better than Tinder
41425:Alisha Gibbs,I like that you can snooze or delete your account without it causing problems for you later. Great app and far superior to Tinder
"41451:FSWZ,""The worst part was I paid for a month's subscription to try it out and apparently I can't see whoever had liked me before that I didn't swipe right on. Other dating apps had this feature, but not Bumble. Also I pay lesser on apps like OkCupid and Tinder, so why bother? Hugely disappointing. Other than being able to see who liked me, there's really no point to a subscription."""
41509:Hisham Haidar,Much better than Tinder
"41572:Derek Skor,""There's pretty much no users here. All the profiles must be fake or old and they saved them. And they robbed me of $47 the very first day and I never agreed to it and now they're trying to say I don't get a refund because it's through an app, that's no excuse to not issue a refund 3 days after creating a account and requesting a full refund. I don't check my bank statement every single day but I did three days later and I seen what they did. Do not use this app. Tinder #1."""
"41592:Antonio Noack,""Ähnlich aufdringlich mit kaufe-Premium!!! wie Tinder; keine Einstellungsmöglichkeit für Entfernungen, und diese manchmal unterschätzt (Luftlinie für alle mit Privatheli...)"""
41619:Nate D,Mostly Fake Catfish Profiles. If someone likes you they won't be revealed until you pay for a membership. The free version just keeps saying I have likes but can't ever get a match when swiping and if I do get a match i get the girl saying add my scam Snapchat then they never reply 😂. Tinder is the same but at least they have more real people. Even the people verified is a model with a fake name so can't really trust this app.
"41627:Shatter316,""Update: Tinder is Better...at least when u match with someone u can msg freely.., WASTE OF MONEY/DO NOT SUBSCRIBE. I Paid 80 bux for 6 months. I should have the right to message whomever I want for that price whether I'm liked or not. I should be able to message people WHEN WE MATCH instead of leaving it up to the females to message me FIRST EVEN WITH A PAID SUBSCRIPTION. I would have had better luck with tinders paid subscription"""
"41660:Gabriel Arras,Took away the shake feature to go back to a previous match... was really the only thing that differentiated it between Bumble and Tinder. I get 2-3 matches every month and then the women don't even message; so it's kind of pointless for them to make the move first."
"41730:Brian Barrett,""Download app and jump through all the hoops. Sign up for a month of Boost. Report 3 accounts in a row for responding in the first message """"u a sugar ddy?"""". Wake up to being banned without a refund at 4am. This app is a scam. Use Tinder till public areas are safe enough to be able to talk to people face to face and skip the trolls."""
41741:Puskar Kumar,Atleast the girls are not fake here in this app. Tinder mein तो ladke ladkiyaan बने बैठे हैं. 🤦🏻‍♂️
"41774:Michael Russell,""Very rare for a girl to make the first move, most of the time you will match but you can't talk to anyone because they have to first, but if they don't within a few days you get unmatched. I've spent a considerable amount of time on here and have yet to ever meet a single person unlike okcupid and Tinder where I have much better success. Pretty sad because this app has potential."""
41809:Andrew A-WALL49,This is no different than Tinder. Same concept with same amount of luck to be matched (not a lot) there is no difference in trying to see who liked you and the people you match with don't even want to start a conversation. Another dead end for me😒
"41902:Aussie Bob,""Shameless cash grab, stick with Tinder."""
"41939:Matt,""I used to give this app 5 stars, but now after they made a few changes they now get 3 stars from me. One of the changes they made was that if you made a mistake swiping left you could go back to that person by just shaking your phone. Now in order to fix your mistake you have to sign up for Boost. They also would let you swipe forever. You didn't have a limit. That's what set them apart from Tinder. Now that's part of Boost too. Those 2 big changes cost them 2 stars from me."""
42095:Mynzelah,Pretty much useless as a free user. Most women who match with you don't message you before their time expires. Anyway to increase the time is limited to a single use before being slammed into the paywall. I've had far more success with Tinder and Plenty of Fish. Don't waste your time on this garbage.
"42105:Ojaswi Athghara,""Very intuitive UI but poor UX. There are so many elements to the app. Those makes the UX confusing. Most women don't know that they have to start the conversation and that too within 24 hours. I really don't know why this app exists in the first place. Same as Tinder, but women makes the first move. They can also do that on Tinder."""
42149:Adam,Pay alot to get boosts etc and cost vs people actually using it are minimal. Tinder has a way better return or hinge. Price is way to much
"42195:thEasy Riider,""Let's get one thing straight: this app is trash. Firstly, the matches wouldn't talk even if you extend the time period until I unmatch them myself. If in 24/48h match doesn't respond, why can't we make the move? The whole concept is lacking. Now to the next point, the app keeps saying OFFLINE while I'm using everything else just fine. I have to reinstall every single time in order to be able to use it. It's really getting out of hand, that's the main reason why I am leaving it. Tinder is better."""
42225:AfrodisiShaq O'Neal,The fact that you have to pay just to see who likes you is absolutely absurd. I rather use Tinder again then get ripped off on this app.
42351:Che Issa,Tinder is better!
42353:Vincent Wesley,The 24 hour gimmick is terrible because no ever responds in time. And now there's a flood of dead inactive profiles and bots what happened to this app? It's now basically a crappy Tinder with a wait period. Update : Just updating the 1 star. Still trash. But now it's limited and filled with bots and sugar babies.
42356:Daniel Patrick,All you need to know is that it's better than Tinder LOL
"42357:Kyo Mocho,""By far the worst dating app. Even Tinder is better because it at least brings your matches forward. With Bumble, even if you get people in your """"hive"""", you have to swipe through 1000+ of endless boredom, absolute WASTE OF TIME, because the coding doesn't bring them to the front. I've talked to many friends and they also experience the same. Even if you miraculously match, they only have 24 hours respond, which is another super dumb design. Bumble truly sucks. Worst app. Don't give them any money"""
42361:Robby Titan,I didn't know expired matches can show back up. Using the daily extend now too. There are not as many free options as other dating apps but it definitely makes up for it in quality. Definitely like this app more than Tinder. Thank you
"42464:PO -T,""Too strong robot reviewing the pictures. You can't add a little text to make a difference. Plus, very small userbase here... Tinder, unfortunately, still stands at the top."""
"42469:Animesh Kumar,""Treats men as dogs. Gives them matches then it's disappears in 24 hrs. Hardly any matches. I had more than 100 matches on Tinder. Even dated many from Okcupid, Happn, Tan tan. Very boring and bad UI. You don't get all the information at one place. Please never install this app."""
"42551:No Body,""This app used to be great but the pay wall is just so insane now. Who would of thought Tinder would make a come back there. Not everyone's there to pay to play. Plenty of other apps that give the user a more reasonable experience, which cultivates the community and quality of the network. But what do I know."""
"42585:Paloma Kostur,""They are letting an abuse victim continue to be controlled by her manipulater. I was 'banned', so I sent 2 emails to follow up. The only person who would report my profile is my abusive former partner, who has done this to me before (reported my Tinder). I explained this but received a dismissive, rude response from 'Mike' at Bumble. After 2 years in a physically and emotionally abusive relationship, Bumble has allowed the control to continue. Sexist, appalling, hurtful."""
42631:Christian Zapien,Better than Tinder!
42695:Dileep Prashank,Excellent dating app. I have 27 girlfriends now and all of them are willing to marry me. Way better than Tinder. I got only 18 girlfriends from Tinder.
42696:Food Is My Weapon,Awful. Go to Tinder.
"42753:Thomas Hyatt,""It's still fairly early days and we've probably only spend 10 hours chatting online and 20 meeting in person, but I think I may have found the woman of my dreams who I will spend the rest of my life with, all through Bumble. 🥰 The app is easy to use, puts women in control and seems to be aimed far more at serious rela tionships then something like Tinder."""
"42775:Peter Damgaard Mouritsen,""Much better experience than Tinder, and more relevant matches"""
"42847:Tamau Roget,""Better than Tinder, that's for sure. I sign up when I'm bored and it's quarantine, so I'm bored. I never keep it long enough to say it's worth much, but I decided to go a little longer than 24 hours, ha! I met someone before a few year's back but the date didn't amount to much. Matches seem to come in and now they have a daily $2.99 fee you can do instead of committing to a full month and so on, so that helps when you get those pesky """"someone likes you"""" alerts."""
"42884:Parker,""It used to be a lot better, but one of the problems I have with it is I cant delete prompts. It only lets me update or pick another one. Also it takes more than a full day to reload your swiping ability. But theres still some great things about the app. Most of the people aren't bots like on Tinder and women messaging first is a great idea."""
"42893:Daniel Koos,""I won't overcomplicate this. You don't pay, you get no matches. You pay, possibly you get 1 or 2, didn't try, and never will. Even Tinder is better, and 90% of the women there are just promoting their Instagram. All in all, this app is a scam, wouldn't recommend it even if they offered me £5,000."""
"43014:Jordan Richard,""They fixed a bug with the spotlight coins I had experienced, I guess. The app is a little pricey compared to Tinder. Other than that it's a good app."""
"43120:C J,""This works fine. I get all appropriate alerts, people respond to me, and the profiles show relevant information about a potential relationship partner. The people getting upset over conversations disappearing should recognize the other person deleted them haha. This is not a flaw in the app. This is a really great free app. Not at all like Tinder, unless you don't make your intentions clear in your profile."""
43123:Kevin Ganz,I got a few matches in the beginning and then I haven't gotten a match in months... Actual months lol... I know it's not me because it's not like that with Tinder. It's pretty obvious they want you to put an absurd amount of money into this
"43161:Stuart Kelso,""Tried this for a couple of weeks to no avail. It doesn't tell you how long untill your swipe rights replenish, if they even do. And it didn't give you many. Kept badgering my to upgrade to get anywhere. Doesn't give you anything different to Tinder or Blendr."""
"43198:POJ Infrared,""Beware of this App, women will use it to stalk you. This app points to every neighborhood you're in. So where you think you have privacy the app clearly provides people with your actual location (not the distance between you/them) like Tinder does. You now are equipped with a mobile tracking device in your pocket. If you're ok with that then the app is pretty cool. For women by women."""
43211:John Perkins,Like Tinder except they expect you to pay for matches. Junk.
"43216:Christopher Burk,""I love the idea of women making the first move! Using Tinder most women expect you to say something so witty and ridiculous, but not all guys are gonna do that. Sometimes you don't want to say something witty and you want to start small. This just makes it so much more comfortable for us guys who aren't always so witty 😅"""
43241:Sazquatch Scotland,You have to pay to see who liked you. I am not doing that. With Facebook Dating and Tinder why pay $30 a month for little chances?
43249:Shubham Dhurve,It's a nice dating app. You can set your preferences as well. Can really compete with Tinder I feel.
"43255:J Man,""The app will give you matches at first, but after an hour the matches stop. I've noticed that there will be a lot of matches in your upgrade que, but they won't show up unless you buy the premium. This means they are locking matches behind a pay wall. This is disgusting. Women aren't a commodity to be traded for money. The women are better than on Tinder, so that's a plus. I'd say 1/10 actually are interested in meeting up, but the rest are fake accounts or women just wanting attention."""
43273:Shubham Pal,Finally we have a replacement for Tinder!
"43289:Valia Corsi,""I've used this app for roughly six months, and can confidently tell you that its one sided by a long shot! Unless you are extremely attractive, it is difficult to get matches. And when you do match with females, a majority of them won't message you anyways. You might as well use Tinder, because that's how useful this app is. The only benefit is that it forces women to break the ice first, which never happens on different platforms. If you are looking for a relationship, I wouldn't try this app."""
"43356:rentaspoon,""Slowly ending up more like Tinder, the 3 free rollbacks are gone, they hide matches so you debate buy a membership. 2 stars because I've had luck on it but if you expect """"classier"""" women than tinder it's not the case, more people with open relationships on it and I've been offered more threesomes than on tinder so I guess there's that."""
"43383:Jadzia 518,""Too much like Tinder. Not much space to write a proper bio. Kept giving me notifications saying I had matches, even a name at one point but when I checked there was nothing. Waste of money and time if you're looking for more than a hook up."""
"43421:Tom Eayres,""Three updates in three days? No notes on updates? Bye, bye Bumble! Pay to see matches....bait and switch just like Tinder. Never pay for a dating app.....ever! All ready uninstalled, why would you reach around for a message?"""
"43477:Eryn Shackelford,""If you can download something else, dont get this one. I had this app back in January but deleted it. I reinstalled it yesterday and I already hate the updates they made. Tinder at least has a swipe limit that resets 12 hours later. But 24 hours? That's insane. And its almost criminal what they charge so u can actually swipe and get matches. Revenue is important, yes but im honestly thinking of deleting it after one day because of how low the swipe limit it and how long the time is to reset."""
"43692:Thomas Buko,""It just doesn't work, the thought sounds good on paper but in practice its very limiting to men and what they can do. Tinder is much better, I can at least send a message first. Also the whole BFF thing and whatever else they added just seems weird to me. Had better experience on pof than on here (and pof is bad to) @bumble support, you guys are nuts and thats why this app sucks 👍 but you keep doing you and wonder why you failed"""
"43740:Abhishek,""Just a pathetic money grabbing sham.You'll get tons of likes in the beginning but eventually they stop coming.And you rarely get a match if you have not paid but after reading the other reviews it seems like even after paying,you don't get enough matches.I downloaded this app because I don't have to make the first move,which is awesome but is it just me or do women really suck at starting a conversation?If you only allow women to initiate but then they don't then whats the point. Tinder's better"""
"43774:D J,""Women text first, except that they don't. They'll either wait for the time to expire, send an emoji or just a simple hi(double standards? How many times have we heard them complain about men sending just hi/Hey/hello?). So what sounded logical is again just a gimmick, it's Tinder but with the guy's hands tied behind his back. You'd have better chances finding someone at the bus stop."""
43798:Det Woj422,Its straight. Better format then Tinder.
43857:Nikhil Mokal,Far much better than Tinder!
"43910:Misha Schmidt,""It could be a good app but it has a few major flaws, first off the fact that you cannot adjust any pictures that you post and instead just have to hope that it fits properly is ridiculous, also there is definitely something wrong with the distance limiter because although I have put my distance as 5 miles I keep getting matched with people who are 10 miles away or farther. Fix these things and maybe give a few undos for free like Tinder does and it would be a good dating site."""
"44034:Freddie Fantastique,""Possibility to send photos, voice messages...a mix of Tinder and Whatsapp. Also a plus every account has a picture!"""
44168:Paul Moseley,Terrible update get 10 swipes a day if you want more pay or it says come back tomorrow. Well thanks for that oh we also want to charge you to backtrack now! So basically you've changed the app/site to pay only well no thanks. Whoever has decided on this change worst decision ever. You've now copied Tinder but gone one worse make you pay to get any use out of the app. Waste of time
"44259:Mich Po,""An app that doesnt even let you contact women if youre a man. And you're just supposed to sit there and wait until someone messages you. Yeah right. This is even more pathetic than Tinder. Never mind the $25 a month you can spend to see who viewed you, but you still cant message them. What a dumpster fire. Delete this app and go outside and talk to people, its way better for your health. Its too bad I have a broken leg otherwise i wouldnt even waste time writing this review."""
"44261:Skyler D,""Used to be really good, now after the updates most things are locked behind pay walls. I see substantially less profiles now and matches have dropped off. It appears they are not showing your profile as often to other people unless you pay more. Old Bumble and Tinder worked very well. Now they are only money grabs. Someone redevelop these! *They also now push the political agenda of Black Lives Matter into the terms of service"""
"44296:Chris Tomiko,""Like the other dick Smorgasbord, Tinder, this app also just destroys woman's ability to make good decisions in the dating market."""
"44346:Mic air,""Worst dating app ever, use match, PoF, or even Tinder this one won't even let you delete your account. Charge for just about everything....simply not worth it go somewhere else."""
44370:Taj Misquitta,Now let me clarify that I'm definitely not an ugly person. I have the same photos and Bio on Tinder and Bumble. On Tinder I typically get 3 to sometimes 4 likes per day on a monthly average and 1 out of 5 is a match. I've been on Bumble for almost a year and I've been putting more attention to it over the last and ongoing months. I've got 4 likes and 1 match and even with boost for a week I have never even got a single match after. The women don't even reply. The app is not worth time or money!!
"44392:Geradessiel Simon,""My experience has been a fair exchange! It has been all,for me all that it endeavors to be-I especially appreciate not having to be labeled gay because I prefer my brother's-having been separated from my brothers as a child & youth. I have used many sites,this one is different,and a better difference:a open """"flow"""" as communication should be-with all the social distancing! For some reason I get more responses here than I did with Tinder!"""
44394:Kyle Hemeon,Matches locked behind paywall. It's basically just a version of Tinder with more expensive micro transactions (As if that was even possible) and less people on it.
"44396:Azrael Seraphim,""Not enough matches, women ghost, and skipping or not wanting to mention something leads to an unfinished profile rather just accepting it and completing the profile. It's now a invalid excuse for you to get less matches. Also, like Tinder, it's not free. I'd get more matches, but would have to pay to see who liked me."""
44540:Richard Williams,Bumble is good option in this complicated world of dating. It's still functional as free app allowing u to like and chat w users once your matched. You can also send photos which Tinder doesn't offer. I've also had good success w dates that are interested in meeting too
"44576:Jeffrey Hamlin,""More classy than Tinder, but not as many options"""
"44599:Dale Janssen,""While bumble is doing well to put a stop fake profiles, they've taken a page from Tinder and are now blocking matches behind their pay wall."""
"44624:Greg,""Latest update keeps freezing and crashing and they took away the free """"swipe-back"""" feature and made it cost money a couple updates ago. Not as many fake/prostitute profiles as Tinder (they're still on Bumble though) which is why it's 2 stars instead of 1. Offer verification, fix your app (I have Samsung S10 with latest updates), aggressively remove snapchat, prostitute, and fake profiles, and bring back the Free swipe back feature to increase your rating👍"""
"44696:Tyler Selesky,""No more backtracks? Time to uninstall, looks like Bumble is now 'Tinder'"""
44759:Dark Zed,You turned into a low class Tinder congradulations on selling out. Instead of limited likes you give us limited people to view asking us to upgrade for more views. How pathetic. You replied saying g we get hundreds of swipes which is a lie. I just downloaded it again and I have even fewer swipes now maybe 30. Stop lying.
"44792:Bij Dikh,""Tinder: 10M+ active users with $9.99-$14.99 per month for membership, and you can swipe your limit every 12 hours without a membership. Bumble: 1M~ active users with $24.99 per month or $9.99 per week for membership, and you can swipe your limit every 24 hours. Don't worry, the developers don't know how to code, so this feature breaks a ton and you can bypass this via brute force."""
"44815:anthony zavas,""Bumble sits halfway between Tinder (shows distance to date) and OKC (lots of written bits). The potential mates seemed hi quality but rarely matched. As for UX, user can click 1st photo of potential mate, but scrolling runs into a snag. Beehive holds many mates but costs. Annoying. Anyway good site and possible dates seem good too. If you could shift from behive to the rate at which dates appear. So you would have free access to behive but they would appear slowly."""
44832:Nada,AWFUL!!STAY AWAY. Each time I emailed them they didn't address the issue and sent a standard response-not even providing a solution.i paid for a week-said bumble booster and cant even use it and miraculously no ones viewed my. Profile and visited users disappeared. Awful.the worst. Tinder are much better and address the issue.this app feels like a scam as I paid for one week and no service oit of it.
"44865:Evan,""App continues to nickle and dime. This used to be so much better, now it's a bad Tinder clone."""
44920:Jeff,I like it overall for providing more info than Tinder. But it's still restrictive. App forces you to provide both a job title and employer name/industry instead of just a title. Same for school and graduation year. That made me knock a star off for lack of flexibility
"45126:Keagan van Rooyen,""Safe, secure and easily matched. Bumble is the best dating app, above Tinder for sure!!"""
45160:Christopher Manning,It's a great app and I've never had any issues of finding great like minded people. Definitely recommend over Tinder.
45165:Marc Wanagas,An app with shittier humans than Tinder.
45192:Dr.Abhay singh,I installed this app for atleast 2 years but didn't got even a single match It's a fake application with fake profiles Fooling people Will not recommend to anybody Waste of time It's better to use Tinder Tinder is better Going to uninstall.
"45222:Ray McCann,""VERY strict photo guidelines, such as no bathroom selfies. My photo was removed because I didn't have shirt on, but it showed from shoulders up. No reason to remove it. Automatic one star from me for that reason. This isn't a religious app, so stop acting like it's one. Rather use Tinder."""
"45301:Chris,""Very simple and user friendly. Uses the Tinder model of like pics>>read bio>>swipe right>>match>>converse, except the girl has to make the first movie (no idea how it works in nonbinary sorry). Keeps matches within your search radius. Easy way to meet locals."""
"45426:M. V.,""Horrible... This app USED TO BE GREAT NOT ANYMORE. I recently installed and started using this app after months of not having it anymore. I see EVERYTHING has changed.. It used to have so many advantages over Tinder but I guess it was just a matter of time till it became a gaff too. You have to pay to do literally any and everything.. It says you have hit your matches limit for the day (after 5 mins of swiping) now 2 days later it still says wait till tomorrow, yet I've been waiting 2 days now."""
"45442:Atiba London,""Not really sure how review this app? It works? Not really glitchy. It's pretty solid for thumb exercise. It has also taught me humility in realizing I'm pretty sure I'm just ugly. Uldate: 5/31: On a real note though, there essentially the same as Tinder now in operations. The backtrack feature (one that's been free for years mind you), is now being touted as some new discovery that's behind a pay wall. AND they've suddenly limited the total number of swipes per day. Just Tinder... But yellow"""
"45481:Henry Steinberg,""This app has gone to HELL. You used to be able to do soooo much more than simply, like or dislike. Now you have to pay to do everything. Tinder is 10 times better"""
"45558:Karl Hinze,""This used to be so much better because it used to have advantages over Tinder e.g. unlimited swiping and free backtracking. Now you have to pay to get anything decent. Backtracking now requires a Boost subscription, and you run out of swipes really quickly. To make matter worse, while Tinder gives you a countdown for when you can swipe again, this just says """"wait until tomorrow""""... which it said yesterday and I've been waiting since! Tinder is bad, this is now worse."""
"45560:Ryan M,""Now with limited swipes, just more Tinder-like garbage. Patriarchal capitalism trumps feminism once again except it's an inside job. You've really done a lot for women by attempting to milk your users for every penny you can, Whitney Wolfe Herd. 'great' 'job' What's the term for an uncle Tom but for feminists?"""
45598:Criss Prima,I'm disappointed that they started charging for backtrack. That was the one thing they did better than Tinder.
"45672:Vincent Nguyen,""I used to like bumble because of the free backtracking, it's what sets it apart from other apps like tinder. Tinder still provides superlikes and bumble doesnt provide anything 🤷‍♂️"""
45685:Daryl Wash,It used to be a great app. They have now gone the route of tinder with limited swipes unless you pay. What's crazy is I actually did purchase some things when the app was free. Not anymore. Updated : You are now not able to backtrack for free. They've pretty much gone full Tinder now. 👎🏾
"45699:Austin M,""It's really neat that I'm paying a monthly subscription and still need to pay for a super like, or whatever they call it. And also seeing an ad every now and then kind of stinks. Tinder has it right."""
"45723:Jack Duff,""I was charged £2:50 a day for 3 weeks when it originally told me I was subscribing for just 1 day. I emailed to complain and request a refund and was refused. Stick to Tinder, people!"""
"45753:Jeremy Warder,""Had the app before and it was a good dating app. Redownload it and have come to realize bumble has taken the EA approach to business tactics. Why make good content for people when they can just lock everything behind a pay walls. When you finally get to use any part of the app it either doesn't work or freezes and forces to close. I finally got to use likes and I got like 5 of them then had to wait until the """"next day."""" Time to delete and go back to random matches on Tinder.."""
"45760:Paul Partington,""Used to be pretty good but then they decided to copy Tinder and bring in a fixed limit on how many times you can swipe per day as well as starting to charge for the 'backtrack' that used to be free. For all the differences there used to be between this app and Tinder, there is virtually none besides men being blocked from showing initiative and able to message first. This is effectively Tinder Lite, and not in a good way."""
45904:aziz hussain,Pathetic dating app ive ever seen in my life... Getting 1 match in 2-3 months... Tinder is better than bumble... Never recommend this to any of my friend.
45918:DEBADYOOTI PAL,Bumble is better than Tinder. Period. It's really curated to your needs and the crowd is really good. ♥️
"45982:0 0,""Better than Tinder and Badoo, use this over them."""
46061:Brock Johnson,Better than Tinder
"46187:Gerald Schneider,""The app itself isn't bad, but user behavior/etiquette leaves much to be desired (m4f, dating mode). Over 2/3 of my matches have failed to start a conversation, which kind of defeats the purpose of the app. Maybe an in-app penalty to discourage this behavior would help? Meantime, please step it up ladies, and save the idle swiping for Tinder."""
"46189:Eric,""Bumble is like Tinder, but better. The only drawback of Bumble in my opinion is the smaller userbase."""
46259:Marie Kris,This app used to be way simpler and safer than Tinder. It has been over 24 hours hours and I still can't see who else i can match with.
"46262:Renata Lang,""Way better and more meaningful than others like Tinder. People on here seem caring and open-minded. The personal profile allows one to showcase core values & traits like your religion (if any); if you consume alcohol/cannabis/cigarettes, have kids; your pets; exercise; star sign; etc. There's also fun prompts for your profile or as a convo starter like: Secret Skill? Favourite pasta? Nicest things someone has done for you? I particularly appreciate the """"BFF"""" mode to make new friends. 💌"""
"46265:Yasmin Eid,""As someone seeking a long-term relationship, I find more serious people on Bumble than on Tinder. I also like its interface, colour scheme, the fact that there are filters other than age and geography."""
46289:Joffie Lovett,One of the only apps that requires verified profiles. Why Tinder isn't able to roll this out is ridiculous.
"46340:Camden Boyd,""I found my forever partner here!!! Never would have expected that. Highly recommended, but make sure you're using Tinder as well to have the best chance of finding someone."""
"46366:Coinrin G,""Overly sensitive to swipes. After remaking an account after having one for 2 years with a slight mistake, the exact same photos have been 'Moderated' and removed with no reason given. I think I'll stick to Tinder for now."""
46371:Sanchit Goel,Tinder is times better
46432:Luxnarr,Better than Tinder I would say
46569:The Alphatron5000,Trash app. Crappy moderation. Stick with Tinder if you still want to swipe.
"46654:Lord Cameron,""4 years and counting with zero activity. It's essentially just an ego boosting app for women, which isn't a bad thing; just useless for men. Think: Upscale Tinder without the payoff of actually making a connection with anyone."""
"46726:Christian,""Good app, a bit different to Tinder."""
"46759:Silver Holland,""Counterproductive. On Bumble women need to open a conversation after a mutual match. But they usually DON'T! Men are wasting their time. Generally I see the same types of women (just fewer) as on Tinder, where no such extra hurdle is imposed... What's the point, Bumble???"""
"46764:Big Gay Inc.,""Was able to swipe through fir one day. It's been well over 24 hours since the app told me to """"wait until tomorrow"""" to go through again. Worse than Tinder."""
"46841:G B,""Bumble used to be a nice option to Tinder, but it too has begun limiting swipes and requesting paid upgrades to continue. It was a good app but like many others has become a generic subscription based dating service. I recommend staying with tinder as it is more widely used and bumble is no longer free."""
46875:M P,I've heard so many stories of people on Bumble being charged for things they did not use or did not know they had purchased due to their free trials. I deleted my CC info off the app and they held on to my info anyway and still charged me because I couldn't find the greyed out cancel subscription option. I requested a refund but obviously these scam artists don't offer refunds for unused services. Stick to Tinder they are so much more accommodating and don't try trick people into paying.
47035:Benette Cezar,I dont like this app! Tinder is better than this..its expensive..i dont know if it really works when you pay!
"47089:Jihad Rasuwl,""This app is good if you are interested in older unattractive women. I met one woman in person and she already had a hysterectomy and was very unattractive in person. Then, she got mad and blocked my number because I didn't text her after our date. All the other women I met on this app were older, uptight, opinionated like my grandmother. There are other apps better than this one, like Tinder and Zoosk. This app was a big waste of time and money."""
47130:Enrico Shippole,Worst dating app I have ever used. 2000 matches on Tinder and multiple dates. About 15 matches on Bumble and it is very unlikely you will get messaged first.
47189:Alex Dloge,The format sucks it's like POF & Tinder in one knock off app that doesn't work right! Horrible interface save yourself the & just download Tinder...
"47208:John Vinecourt Jr,""Loads of matches on Tinder, loads of matches on Hinge, zero matches on Bumble. Constantly have to open close and reopen application to make it refresh, else it thinks today is yesterday and I have to likes left. Don't waste your time with this trash."""
"47216:nikita thumm-rouse,""I love how much you can know about someone before messaging. Lots of details on the profiles, more options than Tinder ."""
"47224:Mark Koenen,""Premium features not worth the money, had much better luck in my area on other dating apps. Matches either don't talk to you or can't hold a conversation. Edit: I'd just like to double down and rate the premium features as a rip-off. There are plenty of better dating options available, such as Match, Tinder or eHarmony, depending on what you are looking for. Bumble is in a tier with Plenty of Fish."""
"47298:Ben Foreback,""Completely worthless dating app. I have no idea what Bumble's algorithm is, but clearly it doesn't work. I've never gotten a match, and I'm a decent looking guy. I've gotten matches on Tinder, OkCupid, and Match, but never on Bumble. Worthless."""
"47329:Shishir Srivastava,""The idea may seem better than Tinder but their algorithm is so crappy. Waste of time: do not recommend. I tried the Bumble 14 day trial and swiped normally. That is to say I didn't swipe right on everyone. Not getting any matches, I had three girls try to find me on Bumble to test if I am even visible. Even after filtering to my profile filters, they didn't find me until almost the very end of the queue. I understand not getting matches, that's just life, but for being one of the top online dating service, they have to either make all profiles equally visible or be more transparent about how their algorithm works. I am betting even after getting their paid service, they are relying on you to pay for the """"Spotlight"""" bonus to make your profile even remotely visible. What a waste of time."""
47347:Paula Lopes,I like Bumble much more than Tinder because people share more about themselves in their profile and especially because most people state clearly if they want something casual or a relationship.
"47373:Trevor Cabrera,""Huge dislike after they changed the app to now allow less swipes per day - I'm aware of the yes limit, but it's so extremely low I deleted the app and recommend you go to Hinge or Tinder instead."""
"47476:Jeff Ric,""Very bad experience. I used Badoo, Tinder, Bumble and others. Badoo was the one that I had more fun and real dating. I have never met anyone from Tinder or Bumble. Bumble has been the worst for a guy. I have been having more interactions on Instagram."""
"47577:Niv J.,""They limited the number of likes to about 10 per day now...which is supposed to increase the quality of matches? But it's no different than CMB, where that model doesn't work. Bumble removed their undo swipe feature, and their Superswipe is about 2x pricier than Tinder's. It's like Bumble decided to adopt the worst of all features from dating apps. Pretty disappointing😑. After scrolling through the reviews, it looks like I'm not the only one who disagrees with the direction Bumble is taking"""
"47622:Sassy Squiid,""The app used to let you """"backtrack""""( if you accidentally swiped left) for free, but now they're charging you $12.99CAD a WEEK to do so VS Tinder which charges you $20 a MONTH for the same thing. It's now more expensive than Tinder with no real perks. The amount of deleted/remade accounts is still astonishingly high, even though I shouldn't have to see the same profile twice after I've already said """"no""""."""
47655:Krus Yaldabaoth,It's less the app's fault than it is with me but I only had deep connections with 2 ppl and it was due to not knowing this was also a business app. The dating side definitely have shades of Tinder which just doesn't attract the right population.
47660:John Nazarene Dela Pisa,It's like Tinder but weird
47738:Robert Borntrager,I just think it's better than Tinder.
"47745:Edgar,""This app sucks, Tinder & okay cupid are better. Super swipes do nothing. Drop this app"""
47758:Duval Kit Borinaga,Tinder is way better. You have to pay to know who you match with. Such a disappointment. I say ZERO STARS.
47845:Chiz TheSaiyan,Worse than Tinder. Limited likes and hungrier for money than a homelessman during a pandemic
"47854:Adolph A.,""I have never had a positive experience on Bumble. I want this review to be simple and straight to the point. It's a money hungry app that doesn't offer any incentive to not use it without paying. And when the incentives are paid for, they aren't worth it. Bumble is a cash grab of the worst kind and preys on people's ideal of starting a relationship through and online dating platform. There are far better apps to use. Hell, I've even used Tinder with success. If Tinder is better, than no thanks."""
47864:Tony,Not as good as it used to be. The swipe right limit is less than Tinder now. They have increased their prices as well. Way to take advantage of the coronavirus pandemic.
"47909:John Hoppe,""Pretty sweet, sometimes it benefits to pay to play so to speak but its a solid app. I like it better than Tinder."""
47929:Anuj Saxena,It's a wonderful app with genuine profiles. It's way better than Tinder or its ilk. True to its objective it truly empowers women by leaving the ball in their court. It also gives us men the satisfaction of knowing that you'll be connected to real people and not some miscreants behind fake profiles. It also gives men the pleasure of receiving pickup lines from women! Highly recommended. Way to go Bumble!
"47962:Kyle Bolton,""Better than Tinder, but that's a pretty low bar. I have made many connections thanks to this app. The paid services are much higher value than tinder. The app appears to have fewer bugs as well"""
"48145:Derek Riggs,""Better than Tinder imo. I think a big reason people don't like apps like these is they don't put enough effort into their profile. Gotta put a little bit of time into your bio. If you're lazy, your results will reflect."""
48169:MiKe S,Worst app cause it takes forever for the swipe to reset for sure more than a day. I get twice to three times as many swipes with Tinder. Matched with over 7 people and zero converstations
48215:chirag kariya,Definitely much better than Tinder
48303:Caleb Morche,Using Bumble instead of Tinder is like using Lyft over Uber.
48327:Justin Beek,Basically Tinder with extra steps
48345:Ugochukwu Owoh,The stupidest app I've seen so far. Can you imagine blocking me just 2days after downloading the useless app. Not as if I like it anyways. Tinder and pof much better. Getting uninstalled ASAP
"48396:Nicholas Johnson,""Actually pretty good! WAAAYY fewer fake accounts than Tinder, though of course they really want you to pay to unlock all the extra features."""
"48411:Zack Hartmann,""It's pretty good. Better class of people than Tinder, but they need to work the kinks out of their messaging platform - I often am not alerted to new messages, and conversely, when I leave a WiFi network, I'm re-alerted to old messages as if they were new. Also, it's constantly telling me """"you're using bumble offline"""", and """"you're back online"""" for absolutely no discernable reason. Overall, the UI is often disconcerted and consistently network latent, but it hasn't stopped me from loving Bumble."""
"48420:Robert Toms,""Nota good app, women normally expect men to send the first message and this affects the use of the app, it needs to updated to be more like Tinder"""
"48421:Jason Cogle,""The app doesn't work properly on my android. When I asked for a refund, I was asked to uninstall and reinstall, which I'd already done. I guess I'll just have to dispute the charge on my credit card. Although Tinder has some scammy stuff going on, I've had better luck with Tinder."""
"48480:Bianca ZeroWay,""Better than Tinder for sure. I don't know how, but the people are much better curated. What I like best is that you can tell right away whether or not someone wants a serious or a casual relationship."""

"48521:Jp Vaca,""Exactly like Tinder, limited number of swipes and wait for a match, minimal to zero profile content, if you want to see you liked you, you have to pay, if you want to """"stand out"""" you have to pay, like all dating apps if you are not very good looking you will need to pay"""
"48528:Virgil Stoian,""Same thing as Tinder. 3 matches after 3 months of using it, none of them started a conversation. What's the point of being on a dating platform if you're not using it? Loads of profiles which are probably inactive. Only good to kill time, but have no expectations from it. Uninstalled. Update: since coming back on the platform, I've had a few matches and I'm currently talking to one of them. We've had to postpone a first date due to COVID-19, but it's only fair to update the rating."""

"48540:Tim,""Just reflecting what most recent reviews are saying. Waited a whole day, swipe 3 times and then the app said I had to wait another 24 hours. Even Tinder averages about 10 swipes per 24 hours. Then I was match with someone 80miles from me even though I set the max distance to 6miles."""
48579:Ramon Silva,Accounts are fake. I have better luck with Tinder

"48705:Froggo Doggo,""Don't bother with this app, Tinder is far superior. The odds of someone seeing your profile compared to Tinder is infinitesimal. Not to mention the fact that even if you do match, the girls never initiate so you just watch the timer run down. On Tinder I can talk first if the girl is too shy."""
"48708:André Fantozzi,""Pretty new to it for now, but I like it over my experience with Tinder, as it actually makes girls (who always say: won't message first) have to start the conversation so it puts them into already showing interest in you! I've got a great match & am happy with it already. Profile layout looks simple & good, it lets you put more info about you even to smaller general details like smoker, drinker, pets, workout etc. It has a good Chat layout & functions as it actually allows you to send photos..😉"""
"48782:Jonathan Davern,""So I am still owed super likes from a previous account or maybe it is the same account, honestly don't know why I came back. The app is designed for you to mess up a waste super likes. Literally just did it twice. Don't both with bumble it's not different than Tinder, people just want you to add there insta or snapchat etc. Tinder has a much better UI, OkCupid has a million questions for better matching. Try those first. And then still don't try bumble."""
"48786:Knight of Astora,""In trying to set itself apart from Tinder, bumble seems to have inadvertently made Tinder more appealing with its limited time messaging function. With Tinder, paying for premium improves your chances of matching significantly but its not needed to use the app normally. With bumble, paying for premium is necessary just to talk to someone if you don't message them within a set time frame which makes it more difficult than tinder to actually connect with people - the entire point of a dating app."""
48887:IcantdenyReality,Better than Tinder
48910:antonio castiñeira,Somehow this works thousand times better than Tinder
48920:Face Man,Somewhat better than Tinder. Still some fakes. They limit swipes.
48969:Krinova Lidia,Very negative. This app is money drainer. The feedback system sucks - automatic reply. Just go Tinder or any other app

49977:Alex Anastasiu,It's a breath of fresh air from Tinder. It's amazing how many beautiful people with common interests you can find when you filter people based on what they're actually seeking

I actually thought the app was better than Tinder when I first downloaded it a year ago and was completely functional, several updates later I'm having the same issues reported by others: -Filters not filter out all men from ONLY WOMEN. -24hrs is too short, but any match I say yes to has 1/10 chance of she initiates a convo. -Notifications of matches that click to nothing shown."""
"50609:Aritra Sinha,""Never matched with anyone in this app, even on Tinder ( free version) I got match but not on this app. Not a good app.. Thumbs down..."""
"50835:Daoud Mohammad,""Been using this app since it came out.... it's just way too expensive. Tinder gives you more out of $10-15. Also the super likes on this app are very low-key: many people won't even notice they've been super liked. So why should I spend my money on you, Bumble?"""
"50951:Michael W Johnson,""This app is a lot like Tinder, and not in a good way. Similar design and visual focus. A lot of gamified features pushing users to engage more with the platform. Try Hinge instead."""
"50971:PokeAlotaSmot420,""This app used to be the best around due to seemingly unlimited swipes per day. Since the new update it tells me """"you've hit the end of the line - for today"""" when I've only swiped right 3 times this morning. Tinder, hinge and okCupid all seem like better options at this point. Formerly a 5 star app now barely 1..."""
"51005:Vince Pappas,""I like the amount of real matches an ugly guy like me can get. Tinder girls never match me, bumble already has 5-6 real matches ive chatted with. Not fake 1000 mile away match bait and switch like tinder does. Plus i dont have to be dumb and talk first and blow it immediately. Great job."""
"51020:A Google user,""Fixes much of what is wrong with Tinder but still a dating app that profits from keeping you using it as long as possible. Plus, a bit buggy."""
"51082:Merle Langlois,""This app is so pimp. I like how it has relationship goals and whether or not you want to have kids on there. The fact that women have to make the first move is okay on a day when you're feeling more trepidatious or passive, or just busy. People on here are more picky and more likely to state plainly what they are looking for. I heard it is more efficient for finding serious relationships. You definitely won't match as often as on Tinder."""
51104:Lady Marac,Tinder with 🐝 stripes. Yuck.
"51190:Kennyknows,""Far cleaner than Tinder. Feel free to define what i mean by """"cleaner."""" Tinder is obnoxious af."""
51194:Stephanie Hartman,This app is better then Plenty of Fish and Tinder put together 🙂
51232:Parth Patel,More responsive than Tinder. Good going!
51315:Manuel Bartels,Excellent way better then Tinder
"51413:Adapted,""UPDATED: So far I like this much more than Tinder. The added info most users include on their profile (height, political orientation, religion etc.) is really useful, and some of the prompt questions give a little more insight into the personality. It seems like a slightly more grown up Tinder, like what the OK Cupid app is trying to be. Only downside is the user base seems smaller, so it's a bit more difficult to find matches (for me at least)."""
"51493:John P,""If you are looking for relationships, Bumble is superior to Tinder. Also, if you are a guy who is dead tired of always being the one to initiate conversation, Bumble is superior since it's up to the woman to send the first message so atleast you know that they're actually interested before continuing. Is it as detailed as OkCupid? No, but it's more streamlined. Overall, I really enjoy Bumble and have had better success in finding matches that have led to something more."""
51533:Nate S,So far it's been a nice app. Interface is a little nicer than Tinder. Distance setting is seem to be a bit off but nothing major.
"51621:Joshua Cassidy,""Just like pretty much all dating apps, Bumble replicated most of it from Tinder. It is an absolute joke, and I honestly think 95% of the women profiles are fake. You more or less have to pay money to have any luck meeting someone, and more often than not the first message you will get from a woman is something trying to data mine from you ... then you wont hear anything back."""
51655:richa ranjan,Better than Tinder but tends to be a bit slow when it comes to receiving messages. Or maybe it's because a very strong WiFi is required. Pretty good experience altogether.
"51715:Neal Bachinsky,""Well, it's better than Tinder, but only marginally so. I like that it gives women more control, and the people I find seem to take things more seriously. However that's where the """"improvements"""" end. Unfortunately they've gone the manipulative route that Tinder also opted for with their paid services. Issues such as people who like me are NEVER seen in my stack, the fact that I seem to get more likes with no subscription, or the ridiculous pricing of the in app purchases only warrants 2 stars."""
"51724:Anthony Gonzales-Martinez,""Bumble is Sexist. I just now unmatch with women on the business platform or avoid swiping entirely because there's no point to try and network with them because they never """"message first"""" and they just sit in my matches wasting space. In bumbles response to my review they even said they want """"equality"""". Im sure a majority of people that work there are mostly women too. You feminists always want to pick and choose what YOU think equality is not what equality ACTUALLY is. Going back to Tinder."""

"51905:Roberts CL,""Doesn't function. Blank page for all 3 interests. Thought it'd be better than Tinder, oh well 🤷‍♂️"""
"51952:0768 E.,""So far Bumble is just BLOWING Tinder out of the water, omg. The bios and pictures are a little weird to navigate but I'm 100% ending my Tinder+ and subscribing to Bumble!!!"""
52034:Dan Angeles,Better than Tinder.
52129:James Bowdler,This app is garbage. They are collecting tons of data and building profiles of their users while also censoring what they think is acceptable for the internet. I never thought I would see a political correct version of Tinder but here we are. Don't waste your time with this garbage.
"52203:Natacha V.,""Way better than Tinder! Bumble matches my vibe more than Tinder. Let's just say, the Tinder culture is not for me."""
"52272:Dostali Demokrati,""This site is just like the others. Stealing money. And no one, answering to you or LIKE. Don't use this app. It's just like Tinder, Taboo and others."""
52320:Taige Zhang,Not that great. No matches. Prefer CMB and Fairytrail better in the USA. Tinder is better when you're international.
52351:Cassandra Pierre,The app was basically like a mixture of Tinder and Hinge except there is less sexual conversations and the questions are not as interesting and easy to start a conversation. The messaging was glitchy and you were never notified when you got a match so if you didnt check your messages within 24 hours you missed the whole opportunity. Not to mention I matched with about 50 people and had zero conversations. What's up with that?
52371:Masoud Zamani,It's not user friendly and it doesn't work. Tinder is better by far
"52390:Rowan Cooper-G,""Good app. Annoying that many women don't start a conversation after matching, so maybe there should be a different/alternative (as an option) mechanism than 'Ladies first'. Not sure why that's more about equality when that kind of sentiment is viewed as more chauvinistic these days, but it's a decent app and I'm seeing a lot more success+matches with decent ladies than on Tinder! Will keep giving it a fair shot."""
"52400:Kyle Español,""This a great dating app. Actually, it is far better compared to Tinder! But is there a way to add a chat head feature in chat?"""
"52458:Chris Marsh,""This app places men as nothing more then puppies in a factory line hoping for the woman to open the door, the fact that only ladies can start a conversation is rediculous. Tinder might be moving to a catfish and hookup hub but at least the playing field is an even one."""
52643:Vivek Patel,The app is awesome. Better than Tinder
"52666:PM photon,""Free ver. A million swipes and no dates. No matter the spread of parameters miles, age ect.. Shame has a good UI. All profiles are PhD's Masters ect. Yea right! Seem to be blocked from others seeing your profile I guess unless you pay! Huge waste of time. Go to Tinder much better now have a bunch of hits there."""
52674:Jeffrey Anderson,App works good. Seems to be a fair number of people on it. More oriented towards relationships as apposed to Tinder.
"52697:Brad Lindsey,""More serious, mature ladies than Tinder."""
52794:Evan McCready,Tinder is garbage but it's still more useful than this pos app. Absolutely useless only 1 match in like 3 weeks and I know it's not my profile that sucks because it works decent for tinder
"52872:Kristian BS,""I've only recently started online dating for the first time and have been using Bumble for 4x months. It is my favourite of the dating apps (I'm also on Tinder, Inner Circle and was on Plenty of Fish). Bumble is easy to use and I've had a few lovely 1st and 2nd dates from it. The fact that the lady has to make the first move in conversation really helps as do small but important personal details like values, height and children. Hopefully something long-term will come from it soon!? 🙂"""
"52903:Miguel Capistran,""Everything goes well, I like the different ways to connect people. But I miss the free super like that Tinder gives"""
53042:Joshua Passarelli,Better than Tinder. People actually talk. It's nice.
53130:Eren Bajracharya,better than Tinder
"53212:Marcus Jenkins,""Dropping this to one star. Auto-photo moderation is broken. Can't upload pictures. Not many people on here, unless you're a woman after the extra features, stick with Tinder. Staff were rude when I complained about it showing existing Facebook friends."""
"53269:Jonathan Enos,""I'd give zero stars if possible. There seems to be no activity at all. I get more matches on Tinder with less time put in, and waaaay more on Hinge. It's practically useless."""
53289:Millicent,Better than Tinder because they're more swipes 😊
53296:Juanplus1,Tinder with a dope verification system and a higher standard of woman and information on them. There is a bio no matter what which is dope to.
53361:Bailey 2468,Tinder is way better then this app there is more ppl on it and ive had wayyyyyy better luck and talked to wayyyyy more girls on tinder but dont ever pay for tinder they will ban you for no damn reason
53383:Aditya Narayan,Good that not free users also have a chance to match with people. Not like Tinder.
"53492:Chris Dixon,""Bumble deleted my account for no apparent reason and refused to give me a refund. Also, when I would get a match it wouldn't show on the list and my messages weren't going through. There is other apps out there you people should download that actually works and free like Tinder, Tagged, and Badoo.. I highly recommend you download these apps"""
53498:Eva T.,Better than Tinder. People make the effort to write a bio. But there aren't enough people signed up in some countries.
"53572:Franklin Slaton,""🤣😂😂😂😂😂 the fact that the owners of this app think people are actually going to pay for this like it's Tinder is hilarious to me. Tinder actually has a good reason to charge because it's a good app, Bumble not so much."""
53579:Jacob Schneider,98 percent of the women aren't real on this site. You might as stick to Tinder
"53631:JC Vela,""Less fake profiles than Tinder. One thing I don't like is that when you have browsed all the profiles in your area, it doesn't show you any profiles ever again, only new people here and there. What if you have a second thought on somebody or you're deadly bored and from all the available profiles you decide to go with someone you previously left swiped."""
53755:Richard Appleby,Having used Tinder and other dating apps for several years this is a refreshing improvement and puts the ladies front and centre #metoo style!
53793:Nirhas Np,I like it more than Tinder
"53817:Terryis Hamilton,""This app is mostly junk. Incredulously low quality matches compared to Tinder, which I hate to say. Also, I hope you like this app using your insecuritues to try and milk money from you. 😉 I've sent a few emails about the push reminders using predatory tactics to get you to spend money and none have been heeded. Use this app at your own risk."""
53837:Robert Polmanteer,So far this app and the people on it are way better than any other cite I have scene. Tinder sucks this place rocks.
"53878:Jeremy Lee,""Better than Tinder, but paid features arent as generous as others. Good concept though."""
"53915:Dominus Augustus,""Somehow, I am able to get over 50 matches on Tinder in a month, but barely 10 after several months on here. Most of the girls I match with don't even bother talking to me, or send me one message, then go radio silent. Don't waste your time and money, guys, this app is purely for women to get an ego boost."""
"53965:Snakes McGee,""Guys, if you thought this would be a refuge from the quiet desperation of Tinder, prepare for disappointment. Matches are seldom and conversations non-existent. Even on an app made for that very purpose, women will not message first. Edit: Also, just look at the number of replies to criticism that boil down to """"Sorry you've had trouble with our Support Team, please contact our Support Team."""""""
53970:Nikolis Tary,Predatory AF. This is just Tinder with a new name. People hit you up to be friends but constantly want sex. Stay away.
"54047:JOSHWillMakeIt,""Never match, Never get notifications of messages, and rarely have women send a message there once in a blue moon I do match. Been on a 100+ dates on 2019 using Tinder and Hinge. Bumble is where hopeless romantics go to die."""
54054:Laura Holmes,Tinder wrapped up as a bumble bee!
"54066:Habib Fanny,""As of 2020, with the filters that allow you to specify what kind of person and relationship you're looking for, with the steps taken to verify profiles, and with the large user base, this is the best dating app bar none. I hardly ever use Tinder anymore."""
54091:Neil Ledford,Tinder is better. Sorry.
54174:jeremy bowling,I've really enjoyed this app. I've met a few nice girls. It also doesn't feel as cringey as Tinder
54269:Joseph Shape,Bumble is a bit more elegant than Tinder. It is nice to have women message me first. Not too many matches yet but I know it takes time.
"54322:Jace Mullins,""Better than Tinder but not seeing as many results as a guy. Bumble is great, you can say way more about yourself and you can pay $3 for one day to test out their Gold Subscriptions. (They dont make it totally clear how to unsubscribe though, shady) Ive had Bumble for 2 months and have had 0 matches, however on Tinder Ive had at least 5 in that time frame. Personally, I think its because girls MUST start the conversation so that makes it more unlikely for them to swipe right. Thats just my op!"""
54330:Vanessa M,I love the face verification method and the way it separates BFF from Dating. Those two things really makes this app stand out against Tinder.
"54341:Noah Holt,""It is set up and works significantly better than Tinder. I'm a guy, and my profile seems to be treated with more respect, so long as I put some effort into it. With Tinder, it's almost like nothing you do matters in the tiniest bit, unless you wanna spend money on it. Even then, it doesn't seem like people use Tinder the way it's supposed to be used anymore. Of course, this app will still try its butt off to get you to spend money on it. As a rule, I don't give these apps any of my money."""
"54370:Hi VLC s,""Maybe if they weren't so pressed to make money more people would first know about. And second more people would be on it. Most of Tinder's features were free when they first started. When you have become popular then you can start charging for features. It make sense why whenever I check Bumble it says, """"You're all Caught Up"""" (No one to see)... Cause there are not enough people on it in most cities. Sad but True."""
"54518:Josiah Henderson,""Not that great. Tinder gives more matches, and the app is screwy I have bumble boost and planned on cancelling before the next renewal. I Logged out and went to log in on my new phone, it made me make a new account, I said screw it oh well, because I had gotten a new card since I made the subscription so I didn't think it would be able to charge me. Somehow it still did. They basically screwed me out of $50 just because their app sucks."""
"54548:Daniel Fanelli,""So, I filed a customer service question about why my matches got suddenly deleted after I had a REALLY solid one, and never got a response. Then I suddenly got his by advertisments to rematch with my old matches that they deleted if I paid them. Now after filing my customer service issue I can't even log in. Tinder might be a crapshoot, but Bumble is a waste management facility about to erupt."""
54590:Alex Styl,App is polished and I have found much less crazy people here compared to Tinder.
"54606:K T,""If Sharon Stone is using this, must be great endorsement. seems easier to use than Tinder, and more genuine response from positive hits."""
54658:Edgar A,Like Tinder without the drama
"54674:Andrew Stempel,""Mixed bag. No more """"control"""" for women than Tinder, and with less information due to the excruciatingly limited text field in the profiles one can post. Like Tinder, contact isn't enabled unless there's mutual selection. Like Tinder, Bumble uses your location - SEARCHING, AND POSTING YOUR PROFILE, WHEREVER YOU TRAVEL AND OPEN THE APP. Bumble is worse because its response deadline compels users to activate the app while traveling to respond in time. Also, the """"backtrack"""" feature does NOT work."""
54679:Josh Horricks,Dont send notifications stating I'm half way to a match but wont give me anyone to swipe on. Tinder trumps this app by a landslide
54687:Nathan Benson,It's so far better than Tinder or Grindr
"54760:Aman Kapoor,""Make the about me section equal to Tinder, 500 characters or more."""
"54841:Pascal Horisberger,""Only been on a day or two, but seems a damn side better than Tinder."""
"54875:Tacotravis,""Way way better then tinder. Tinder sucks, bumble is the way to go."""
54902:john kilburn,Awesome as Tinder
"54932:Jill Colleen,""Deceiving... I did not intend to purchase 7 months all up front! They brake down how much it will cost per month, then charge for the entirety of it. So after meeting someone, within the first month (on Tinder! NOT Bumble!) I'm now obligated to have the account for an additional 6 months. WHY?! The app is for meeting someone, and now it appears as if I'm """"keeping my options open"""". So does Bumble know something that I don't? Your app doesn't work? You're better off with Tinder!"""
54967:Epi Fabonan III,It's slower to get matches than Tinder.
55033:Mikey Radziminski,This app is a bootleg tinder that makes you pay when you match. Not worth it. Tinder is way better
55035:FilmGamer,I didn't get a real life date on Tinder (which I am banned from) but I got 2 real life dates on Bumble. 1 didn't go beyond the first date and a 2nd did but I wasn't in the right space at the time. After a while I complained to support I wasn't getting dates and what should I do? They gave me free Bumble boost to help. The fact that women draw first even if it is just to say hi makes a huge difference as men aren't forced to lead the conversation. One of the best dating apps out there by far.
55037:Marvin Quitoriano,I like it better than Tinder
"55059:Ramakrishna Rao,""Rewriting this again after an year of use, Dec 2019,still think its a waste of an app i have even tried premium membership, and let me tell you it's a waste. If Tinder is a place where gus simply swipe right to every single girl and cat fish. Bumble is a place where the girls just check the app for time pass and are just searching for something even they are not sure what. Sorry girls but it's true it's full of inactive users, and Bumble says only current active users within 1 month FALSE"""
"55094:Peyton Frye,""I constantly get notifications that someone has liked me, only to go into the app to find that there's nothing there. It also keeps saying I'm all caught up with my potential matches, but a few hours later there's always more. I expected more from this app than just being Tinder lite. Waste of time"""
55185:P Rivera,Love that girls have to message you first lol. It leaves room to actually have a decent conversation since girls are so used to dudes always messaging them first. Had a couple of good matches and I like where things are going unlike Tinder. So good app!
"55332:M Diaz,""Forces the updates. Tinder is not like that at all. Otherwise, good app. Only 1 star due to that technological aspect."""
55354:Chicken Bowser,Better than Tinder.
55477:Vhs Vhs,Better than Tinder tho
55592:Mj Benevides,I don't know what happened but having no limit on swipes is what set you apart from Tinder. Now it's been OVER 12 hours and still cant swipe. I'm over it.
55594:2048,Below average experience and I've a date. Think it's time to move on. One odd thing i found out through out the time I've spent using the app is that I never had any match without making the first move (Tinder is better). The one good aspect of this app in my opinion is that there are less h*es than there is on tinder
"55683:Joe Russell,""Extremely low profile exposure. 'Boost' is useless, and 'Spotlight' grants you a single match that doesn't meet your age or distance filter. No free 'Super Swipe', unlike Tinder, so there's no reliable way to display your profile to a genuine interest unless you pay. All very expensive, and counter to the Dev's ideals, this app reinforces the stereotype that women only care about money. Nobody should have to pay to find love. Corporate greed at its worst."""
"55712:Mrs. Vernon,""After using the app for 2 months, I can give a accurate review. Never has an app let you set up preferences and repeatedly match you with people outside of those. I read their response to a reviewer who complained about this and they said it was to give you the most matches. It is not about quantity it is pref. If I don't want kids stop matching me with people with kids. The app is becoming a polished version of Tinder. Even the BFF side is a bunch of women looking for hookups."""
55854:Danny Di'Niro,Better than Tinder but you still need to be pretty to get anywhere
"55878:Victoria Helm,""It's Definitely better than Tinder and way easier to find ppl who are interested in the same kind of relationship, but I have a cognitive disability and it's a little hard to stay focused on and the white and yellow give me a headache. I've yet to find any accessibility options as well. The usage and chatting, as well as meeting people are all really greatly done (not that anyone's talking to me. (But that's a personal problem lol.) If you don't have the issue I do, then I would 5/5 recommend it"""
"55913:Joshua Daniels,""No matches for weeks, women are cowards. I know I'm not ugly or boring because I have 50 matches on Tinder. literally can't get matched when I swipe right on everybody due to how infrequently I find someone who will actually have the courtesy to message me. I find it mind boggling this app caters to women and even gives them responses to send out but they still won't approach you after matching and all I can do is watch the timer count to 0. Trash app for men"""
"56012:Ethen Wise,""Told to be different from Tinder, holds all aspects but the good ones. As Bumble spoon feeds only few profiles at a time and only promoted times women are aviable. I ask for someone to be so kind in making a sating site that caters to a more male base. Considering it's harder for a man to get what he wants, than a women."""
"56084:Amitesh Gaurav,""More useless than Tinder. I know you thought it was not possible, but trust me, it is."""
56097:Jack Fox,Interface is better than Tinder.
56141:Gabe Akiyama,This app is glitchy doesn't confirm pictures delete pictures that meet their criteria. its just overall a horrible app. There are other apps that are similar like Tinder that will open up much easier and confirm your photos much easier than this app does. Garbage app.
"56142:Mostafa Mo,""WASTE OF TIME I could not be more disappointed in online dating apps, especially Bumble. It's better than Tinder but still useless. Can't see who liked you unless you pay. Won't be recommend to anyone unless you pay. No one will know you liked them unless you pay. Without spending money, you won't get a date, even after spending money, you may or may not. NO GIRL IS WILLING TO SPEND MONEY ON A DATING APP AND THE ONLY WAY THE GIRL WILL SEE YOU LIKED HER IS IF SHE PAID FOR THE BOOST MEMBERSHIP."""
"56180:Aaron Elliott,""I like the app so far. It's real people looking for real connections. I like that it has a separate space to find friends and make business connections. Comparing Bumble to Tinder, Bumble is hands down better. Tinder is good for shallow hook ups but it's also has alot of weirdos unlike Bumble. It does suck that the women has the be the first to message and they are limited to 24 hours to do so but it is a good formula."""
"56235:J. O.,""3 months of me using Tinder: got many matches, met several interesting and fun people, began relationships, and made new friends. 3 months of me using Bumble: not one match... Are there people even on here? Don't waste your time. This app is trash"""
"56319:That Dude,""For what the apps worth, it has a good set up. You can add more details to your profile and there aren't many pay walls all over the place like Tinder. Also I like the girl has to message first. The app is a lot more polished too. As for the people in it, it still sometimes has bots and people not even trying the app any more, but it isn't as bad as Tinder. Also there are more people trying it seriously in the app. Overall the app is fair."""
"56507:Taj Harvey,""I like this app a lot! It's extremely easy to use and allows you the freedom to choose, in depth, what you're looking for. It's a more mature approach to dating over Tinder."""
56519:Eneas Núñez,This is the worst dating app out there. The worst experience you've had on Tinder doesn't compare to this app. Stay away
"56546:Steven Dicks,""Horrendous. This app used to be great. I had matches all the time. Now I'm lucky if I get 5 in a week. I'm not even horrible looking, but it seems that they either withhold matches or just have issues. I've had much better luck with Tinder and had 4 to 5 times more matches. I would not recommend anyone use this app. It's on the same level as POF now."""
"56592:Ryeshia Farmer,""This app is awesome! Much better folks than you would find on Tinder, and has a more cashal nature than something like LinkedIn would offer. I also apprecoate the lengths that they go through to make sure that all parties involved feel comfy. I just wish the BFF feature allowed me to match with guys as well as gals"""
56596:Max H,Much better than Tinder.
"56676:EVAN GARDINER,""The overall Concept in theory works but in reality it's not as successful as you would think as people are afraid of rejection... But my gripe about the app itself I've experienced more connection issues than any other I've tried including Tinder, OkCupid, POF and more. A lot less bots but there are still more than i would like. Need to improve the issue with resetting filters. Not liking the push for more and more paid features."""
56811:David Mchale,Matches are rare. Some even randomly disappear when notification is given. Lots and lots of fake profiles. Just look at the names and the photo manipulations. App getting as bad as Tinder. Outdated and worn out.
56815:Alex Morales,Better Then Tinder 👌
"56833:callum rooney,""Complete rip off of Tinder! Don't believe the hype, this app took all the bad points about tinder and made them worse!"""
56951:Faron Hartley,Shame they've decided to massively curtail the matches you're given without paying for it. It was the one thing that stood this app apart from Tinder.
"56952:Mouse Scarbrow,""Ridiculously """"woke"""" and dead, and the timers rush you into either communicating or giving up on the person. Not a good method for people with a life. The app itself is useless compared to a browser. At least it hasn't become another whorehouse like Tinder."""
"56966:Matter Stambaugh,""This app is borderline if not outright fraudulent. $50 and not a single decent match. I live in a metro area near a major university. My filters are broad.

"56970:Taylor Wray,""Much more success finding matches here vs Tinder and Happn. Nice work, Bumble team!"""
57039:Paul Mushell,This app is more dead than tinder. All my matches I saw are not in my 5 mile range. I cant seem to get any local matches. I'm about done with this app. Tinder's cheaper too and I get a lot for my dollar.
57041:Marc Stifelman,Better experience for me than OkCupid or Tinder. Happy to give women the initiative. Seems more relationship oriented.
57079:Maxwell Nelson,I like the idea. Better than Tinder over all
57119:miyah hayes,Bumble is like the more innocent but more organized version of Tinder. I have been using Bumnle for about a month now I really like the results.
57130:Britany Nield,So much better than Tinder! Ha!!

"57204:Yacob Yennett,""The app is glitching and forcing the """"backtrack"""" option on every swipe, whether it's left or right.. This is without prompting the option at all.

"57415:Kevin Allen,""Tinder is better, so is Quickmatch."""
"57465:Alex Allder,""If girls make the first move they shouldn't also see your images. They should at least be forced to pick based on merit or bio alone. Also, prepare to get ghosted. People match then say nothing and it's like Tinder all over again."""
57554:Robert Swift,Easier to use than Tinder. Know a bit more about the person your looking at too!
"57599:Stert Quarry Farm,""Easy to use. Good that females are in control of making the first move. Nice screen movement up & down, so that it is easier than Tinder to view people's profiles."""
"57680:Jeffery Stanzer,""Being able to search by relationship style and distance is a great improvement over completing apps like Tinder, but there aren't many people on the app (meaning few search results), and those that are on here are largely inactive. As a guy, not being able to send the first message sucks, and all of my matches have failed to login within 24 hours and have expired. I made the mistake of buying Bumble Boost, which gives almost zero features and has q confusing interface (no tutorial)."""
57730:Coury Dorn,110% better than Tinder.
"57737:Ryan Lowder,""Terrible. I have used this app in the past and was very pleased.

57886:Arham Reza,Experience is not really good. I've moved to spotlight trail plan but only 1-2 matches so far which are their for either Instagram or do not initiate the conversation. Had many matches in Tinder though.
"58028:Mike JP,""On one hand, it's better than Tinder as you can better specify details of your ideal match (height, kids/no kids, etc), but having matches disappear after 24 hours means most women never get to their matches and it's up to the guys to extend, but can only do it for one a day. I get you guys are trying to make money, but that trips up the chances of people trying make connections"""
"58056:Brandon Gacuzana,""I get the sense that for every person who swipes right on me, this app will show me 100 people who EVERYBODY swipes right on and are just insanely out of my league. I can't get a freaking match. Maybe I'm just ugly. Oh well, better than Tinder"""
"58095:Brian McGowan,""Bumble is better than Tinder,with less scammers and insincere attention-seekers.

"58275:Matthew Castle,""At a guess, i would say that the number of matches I've received on Bumble is easily ten times less than on Tinder. If I were to base my self worth and attractiveness as inferred by this app, I would be better off leaving society and living in the wilderness until I succumb to my obvious deficiencies as an uninteresting human being. The only legacy i would leave behind is being the first person to die of bumble induced low self esteem. Two years, one date later, the forest is starting to beckon"""

No one actually ever messages you back if you ever do get a like or match. The worst part is these apps are almost entirely fake accounts. Steer clear, i had paid accounts for all 3 thinking it would make the experience better but it wasn't so. I'm hoping they shut downs these scam sites soon."""

It's all pretty confusing. Oddly, I've had much better conversations/meetups through Tinder 🤷🏻"""
"59098:Ross Ziskind,""It's takes too much time to see pictures.... Tinder pictures load faster, and instead of swyping down in this app, I can just tap in corner to see more pictures.... It's easier. But I like how only females can message first in this app."""

59116:Paul Pinto,App is good but women anyway are the same. Tinder is overcrowded hence it feels great to have 3-4 matches good. The tagline should be the same one eBay has - ' eBay/Bumble bcoz you just searched on Amazon/Tinder '
"59147:J A,""Although i haven't gotten a date yet, I like this app over others, and it's more user friendly than Tinder for example. The only thing i would complain about is the price for boost. But I understand it's a buisness so I don't mind it"""
"59294:Matt BenDaniel,""Bumble is missing a crucial feature that Tinder has. When traveling, Tinder allows me to swipe matches near my home location, as I'm looking for a LTR near home. Bumble is effectively useless when I'm travelling. I don't understand how product management can be so clueless."""
"59336:Thora Eriksson,""Tinder is much better. I'm pretty sure most of the men on Bumble are super lazy & just swipe right on everyone. Matches rarely respond, which hasn't been an issue for me on any other app, and if they do they are often incapable of holding a conversation. I think it was an interesting idea to have women start the conversations, but in reality men are the ones swiping right on everyone without consideration. They should be forced to start the conversation & prove that they are actually interested."""
"59382:Chris PlagueScape,""OkC, Tinder, & even horrid PoF have gotten me dates. This app on the other hand after almost a year & spending money on it has delivered nothing. Fact ladies go first was a huge draw but even when you do match no one talks on here. I've legit seen girls with """"I wont message fist"""" in thier profiles, so you can never talk to any one cuz ladies MUST go first & they never do. Change app so girls """"right swipe"""" by sending message & only show guys the girls that already sent them a message."""
59431:Gabriel Ramirez,More classy ladies than what Tinder offers.
"59496:Jeff Martin,""Who decided to implement the absolute worst element of Tinder onto Bumble? The idea of limiting the amount of """"likes"""" you are allowed in a day is absolutely absurd. That is 100% financially motived and is nothing but a negative for users. Poor choice, Bumble."""
59519:Gautham V,Abysmal experience.. Tinder is better by leaps and bounds
"59558:Thaddeus Burr,""*updated Oct 2019* Better than Tinder for two main reasons: They aren't trying to grab every penny in your pocket (yet), and currently it has a smaller and more serious userbase. The app itself is more comfortable than Tinder as well, in my opinion. HOWEVER, this app will daily give you notifications that """"activity is really high in your area!"""" etc, when in reality it's completely untrue and only two new profiles are in your feed. This app's notifications are utter lies."""
59615:Mel Grosse,Better than Tinder
"59786:zaskar30,""Nothing wrong with the app, it is the billing. I paid up till Jan 2020. Reinstalled, just noticed they billed me mo Ty several times. Tried to find a way to contact via their website. Nothing. Please refund all the monthly charges. You could learn from Tinder. It does not matter if you logout, close your account, or uninstall. If you go back on, have a paid subscription that is not run out, it automatically uses it. Thx for the reply, I am not on FB or Twitter"""
"59792:Erik Gentzel,""Either the algorithm-matching system on Bumble is better than that of Tinder's, or there are just higher quality people here - either way my experience has been better so far here than on Tinder. Layout is very nice and intuitive which is a huge plus - probably the best layout of any of the dating apps in my opinion. Profile is probably the most customizable compared to any dating app. Would highly recommend this app over others if you're picky and looking for serious relationships."""
"59827:Marcus Tham,""Horrible platform for males. You get matched with a girl, and most of the times than not, the girl doesn't even send you a text. Therefore wasting your time and effort. Some may even argue these girls might not even be the ones swiping right on you and might be a ploy to get guys to buy credits to extend their 24hrs match. Can't recommend using this app. Try Tinder or Happn, you'd have better chances there."""
59925:Diego Encarnación,Way better then Tinder.
59980:Stephen Burton,Don't get the bots like Tinder
59986:Steven Cobb,If there were more people It'd be better. Still a fun game however. Update : improving with time The concept is more fun than Tinder
60124:Mele Nico,Was good until I got banned. No recourse in this area. Similar to Tinder judge/jury and executioner 😂😂😂. I suspect was salty women. These things happen. Wouldn't pay for this app however. I did send two emails at BubbleSupport but no response as well. You still haven't got back to me. So basically you say you will get back to me but that is to appease customer service however you don't execute. So pretend customer service. See the difference with Tinder is they don't pretend 😂😂😂.
"60136:Cheyenne Weber,""Way more in depth than apps such as Tinder. You can set up profiles to tell people the little things like height, are you a smoker, what you are looking for and even your religion. It's nice if you are looking for a relationship to be able to filter people out before swiping! The only negative thing is having to pay for super likes or boosts. But I wouldn't choose any other app over this one. I also find the idea of bumble bff cool too (looking for friends not dating) which you can switch to"""
"60150:Vincent Maverik,""Absolutely useless. I bought premium cause I had 3 matches and it didn't let me to see them until I upgrade. After upgrading they disappeared. I have swiped over 1000 girls and I was getting only ghost matches that have expired with time. Extending time - useless. After premium ended I've received a message that I have a match, but I have to upgrade to be able to see that person. Services like this should be removed and managers should be prosecuted for fraud. P.S. I had success with Tinder."""
60220:James M,Less shallow than Tinder
"60256:Eric H,""Pretty good. I'd prefer if they had passport like Tinder. Also, if someone swipes you, you have to swipe on them. If you swipe left, you wont see them again l. I'd prefer their like be saved and I choose when I want to match"""

60516:Dylan Hauke,Beats Tinder in about all aspects
60527:SODUCCM !!!,Either the profiles are fake or it's someone looking for a sugar daddy. This is worse than Tinder. I would say maybe 15 percent of the profiles are real. Low score because they allow girls to solicitate relations for money.
60534:Will Marcus,For someone that travels frequently not being able to force a location is a problem. I'm interested in singles at home not on my travels. This functionality turns this into Tinder....
60535:Karen DeGrazio,Worse than Tinder
"60555:Preston Rodriguez,""Boooo, don't upgrade your app!! The app said update to check out new features, so I update and now all of a sudden bumble limits your swipes like Tinder. No reason to really have this now if it's the same as Tinder"""
60574:Eric Allen,Been on a long time I paid for Boost and Spotlight but I didn't really see any effect. I didn't get more matches and the few matches I got over the month and not a single one messaged me even I extended the time. That tells me they're bots which is something I've suspected for a long time. what's the point of making it so women message first if they dont. I get like 4-6 matches a day on OKC and 1-2 a day on Tinder. To only get a handful in a month with paid service... definitely not worth it.
"60575:Dayne Williams,""While I like the concept the truth is nobody uses this app, it is completely dead. A couple years ago I checked it out, waited for it to pick up but it has still not progressed. Tinder is way better."""
"60653:Jason Bennett,""Waste of time. You won't match anyone unless you are willing to pay extra. NOT FREE, PERIOD. Stick with Tinder, free and as advertised."""
"60678:SomeRandomGuy,""Seems pointless. 3 weeks on Tinder and I have 20+ matches, on Bumble? 2. And one didn't bother to message. Got a free """"Bumble Boost"""" and it made no difference, so whats the point? Pay to lose."""

"60731:A. Julian,""The best dating app right now, but still has some flaws. Three preselected characteristics are displayed in varied order from profile to profile and for the free profile, the people out of range who swiped right on you never get shown to you, but are still displayed in your queue of people who have liked your profile which is annoying. Still, this app is preferable over Tinder, Hinge, and OKC, which I've also used."""
"60771:S inSF,""STAY AWAY! WASTE OF TIME! It is obvious the Bumble techs have quotas and create too many fake profiles along with the other spammers here. Bumble is worse then Tinder in fact. In fact, if you report the many prostitutes /sugar babies, they will in turn report you and get your account flagged Seems clearly Bumble needs anyone they can get to use their app and will allow the many spammers over real people."""
"60779:Justin Geisler,""I think this is a great concept and the people seem to be MUCH classier than some of the other apps I've been on. However, I wish they would incorporate a daily free token or something like Tinder does with their free daily """"Superlike"""""""

60836:Idole Lydia,The people I've talked to here are different from Tinder. It's a good Thing that the app has the option to say what you are searching for in the bio. The free version is perfect no annoying adds which I am very thankful of.
"60839:pferd,""My experience with Bumble, even through subscription is the worst dating app I've ever used. In comparison to Tinder, Okcupid, and the new Facebook Dating, this has to be the sketchiest service I've ever had. I deleted my account months ago, and yet since then, they keep trying to charge me for a subscription. To further validate this, I've deleted my account through the settings where it asks you to type """"delete"""". I've got a refund last time they charged me, and now I'm being charged again."""
60919:ZaniOfdallas Harper,Great app better then Tinder.
60931:Mayank Sharma,The new upgrade has resulted in limit on profile viewing. Unlike before. That's not done by Tinder. I am not really fond of these cheap tricks which are done by B-grade dating apps. Not interesting Bumble.
"60952:David Hnilica,""Tinder, but worse in every respect. Fewer people, more complicated (matches disappear automatically, way too pushy) and more expensive (Tinder at least gives one free SuperLike per day). Also, the free premium for 14 days is a scam (useless and renews automagically for 3 months). One star for at least giving an option to fill in the basic info (height, smoker) in a tag, instead of having to use bio...."""
60957:Kyle Fall,Better than Tinder IMO
"61020:Better Days Sanctuary,""You know, the women on here are the highest quality that I have seen on any dating app especially when compared to Tinder. The only thing is the business practices of Bumble seem to be a bit underhanded at times. For instance, they actually don't show you women who have liked you in the normal swiping option in hopes that you will pay extra in order to see these people. If you do pay extra, it will be over $20/mo which is a bit crazy. Would really prefer ads instead of withholding matches..."""
61075:Austin Little,Way better than Tinder. Less bots and more classy people that aren't just looking for hook-ups.
"61157:Dan C,""Good matches, but most looking for LTR not fun friendships even when they select the """"I don't know"""" option for relationships. It seems to have mainly profiles of more professional/upscale people with discretionary income to travel as shown by their selfies... It is better than Tinder, and a much much better than POF and other similar dating apps."""
"61162:Simeon M,""Having the girl message first isn't a bad idea; however, most of you matches will match for no reason and let the match expire. I am a decent looking guy with a lot of personality traits and yet I have only had about 7-15 matches on bumble while using it for almost a year and maybe 3 of those matches actually sent a message. In comparison, I had over 14 matches on Tinder in about 4 hours one time, and half of those girls responded. So I think bumble should reconsider its algorithm."""
61270:Mey Delicatta,The guys were all sex crazed a-holes. If I was looking for sex I'd go to goddamn Tinder!
"61306:A. LuisDiaz,""Every day I have notifications saying someone wants to meet me , but it is always false. Tinder is better and that is an awful app too."""
61386:Wilfredo Valle Jr,The best dating app among Tinder and Hinge in regard to the application's design and organization. Though I feel it should be a paid only app as it's free use is just someone's waste of time waiting for the rare chance that someone swipes right on you after you swiped right on them. The amount of time it would take for a match to happen that way can take so long that you delete the app or account before the other party gets to stumble on your Bumble and MAYBE swipe right. Gets discouraging fast.
"61394:Phil Briggs,""similar app to Tinder although Bumble's main appeal, which sets it apart from Tinder, is the requirement for the female individual to make first contact should the pair match initially. So I like this feature"""
"61481:Alexander Miller,""I didn't realize until I signed up that this app also works for gay men! Lots of really great guys on here, people respond far more than on Tinder. If you want guys serious about dates, you may want to check this one out"""
61538:Nicholas Hale,Like Tinder but sexist and with a time limit to talk to your matches! :D
61646:Wally,On android the app constantly mis-swipes. This never happens on any other dating app (such as Tinder) and its frustrating. It's as if the app is randomly and purposely amplifying random profiles swipes whenever it deems it necessary.
61697:Marco Polo,Much more mature than Tinder
61781:A R,This use to be a great app but now it's a Tinder hybrid:/. Most of the men just swipe right without even looking. Please clean the site up and put men in the back of the line or delete thier account if you see they are mostly swiping right then deleting after a woman swipes right and says nothing to us. So lame. The filters don't even work to help a woman out.
"61842:Joel D,""Better than Tinder, less seedy and much more thought put into the app build. Works great."""
61850:Richard Lubbe,Better than Tinder in my opinion. Although it's still a bit too expensive.
"61851:Tim Hersh,""Tinder sucks after a recent update. I can barely match with anyone on their new algorithm. I used to match with many more girls on Tinder vs Bumble, I use a very similar profile on both. Now I get way more on Bumble so I'm here."""
"61854:Ryan Toomey,""App does NOT work. I literally spent hours swiping right on hundreds of women, but nothing happens. There is no way to actually communicate with them. When I go to match queue it just shows blank circles day after day, there are never any matches that show up. I even changed my pictures and profile and still nothing. This app is a waste of time and a SCAM! Heck, I got better results on Tinder than this."""
61918:sarab Hayre,Great way to meet new friends. Better than Tinder!!

Support staff are unhelpful, unwilling/unable to resolve.  Stick to Tinder or OKC.  EDIT IN RESPONSE TO BUMBLE BELOW: As with all your other responses, you try to look like you take action but your support team do nothing. You've avoided the main complaint here - as have your support team - the *misleading push notifications* sent when you know the account is not being used, which make it sound as though the account is inactive whilst you continue to sneakily take people's money day in day out.

63051:Sean Gage,Way more detailed and thought out than Tinder
63053:Junaid Siddiqui,Bumble is so much better than Tinder...
63056:Kris Kahmann,Good alternative to Tinder
"63108:Shwetang Keny,""I didn't got any Single match also in this app. On Tinder I got 5 and on OkCupid I got 7. Why I am not getting any match? I know girls should also swipe right to get a match. I thought Bumble would be much better than any other apps, so first downloaded Bumble. But I am getting better result on Tinder and OkCupid. Please try to improve your app (UI and Algorithms) to make it much cooler and attractive so that people will use this app."""
63131:GY,Better than Tinder!
"63159:M Lynne,""I have used Tinder, OkCupid and Bumble as my dating apps. Between the 3, Bumble has the most boring dudes that don't know how to hold a conversation, if they even respond at all (a majority do not). the few guys that I did meet because I thought they were interesting enough, turned out to also be very boring in person. I assume there is a correlation between men that want women to message them first, and introvertedness. hence why i recommend OkCupid instead, the men on there have backbones."""
63172:Denell Graves,by far Bumble is better than Tinder
"63214:Chee Kiat Teo,""a lot of inactive users, go for Tinder, save your time"""
"63302:Kathleen Wong,""So I figured I would try Bumble since Tinder didn't work out. Fortunately the second guy I matched with was a pretty cool person. That experience was fine but note, it was within a week of me being on the app. So there was high exposure/a higher percentage of matching with someone. Fast forward some time later, no matches, or I match with someone I never swiped on, distances go beyond what I set it to, notifications lag, etc. it's a bittersweet app so far. Not sure I'll stay on it much longer."""
"63328:Joshua Dickerson,""Not bad.. Nothin much came if it yet, but still more respectable than Tinder.. Lol.."""
63376:twilight westwind,better than Tinder in every way possible
63547:Daniel Oosthuizen,Better than Tinder by far.
"63548:Erica Sylvatica,""i like bumble a lot better than Tinder, in terms of format and in terms of quality folks on the platform. I especially appreciate not accidentally """"super liking"""" someone while trying to read their profile. I'll probably not go back"""
"63640:Greg Burman,""Decent dating app, and a much better concept than Tinder"""
63686:-,You do realize that it's common knowledge your app is full of fake profiles right? Like%60 of the women on here don't exist. And I'm not talking about the spam profiles you see on Tinder.  These are clearly put on there to make it look like Bumble is loaded with gorgeous women.
"63692:LaVonne Patoir,""compared to Tinder, it's much easier to be open about what you want/ what you are looking for. that makes things 10x easier. easy interface. ive tried using the BFF mode as well (abroad) to little success, but maybe others have had luck. never used to Business option."""
"63741:santosh kanigicherla,""Need to improve on the App optimisation. Currently I feel its pretty heavy application and it takes lot of time to load the profile. Also, they need to work on the pricing. Its charging pretty high than its competitors, so if you want to increase your users, especially in India you need to do better than what you are doing currently. Tinder is way ahead on the pricing front."""
63786:Matthew Garman,Better than Tinder..
"63847:Nick U,""This app falls in line with every other predatory dating app available today. They over push premium features, have terrible customer support, and allow for thousands of fake or inactive accounts to stay active. Do not download! Worse than Tinder. Update: Bumble support thinks Facebook or Twitter DM's are proper customer support. Get an actual phone number or email address and act like a real company with customers instead of some scam app piggybacking on other apps."""
"63876:M. A. Packer,""Used this app for a week after a friend recommended it, and stopped using it soon after. Not because it sucked, but because I met a nice girl and we're now in a serious relationship, considering marriage. Used Tinder and Mutual for years with no success beyond a few dates. Not saying Bumble is guaranteed, but it did help me find a great woman, and the fact they require women to make the first move actually seems to have helped considerably. Definitely recommend it."""
"63898:Eric L.,""Simple and functional, but not a great experience for the average guy. The concept of women messaging first is great, but this rarely stimulates engagement or more respectful conversations than with either gender initiating. At times, this app felt more superficial than Tinder. Superswipes, Spotlight and Boost are completely overpriced and generally a waste of money, especially compared to other apps' subscription services."""
"63939:Kya Cooper The Soundtrack Of My Life Blog,""I have a much better experience with this app than with Tinder, POF, and most other dating apps"""
"63941:Ryan Peterson,""It's Tinder with filters. A lot of dating apps have done a poor job differentiating themselves, Bumble included."""
"63990:Roy Kilgore,""Its a good app, and I really like the concept. The reason I gave 3 stars is because there seem to be alot of fake profiles, and they will make you pay to see any pending matches. However, it is, by far the best dating app out of Tinder, POF, and okc."""
"64039:Drew Schroeder,""bumble has a day filter - mostly accurate. i set it to """"active"""" girls and boom! super easy to use. the membership is too expensive for my taste though. i don't see much benefits. no stupid elo score algorithm like Tinder."""
64115:Tristan Banks,Better than Tinder but still pay to win. Also the fact that girls have to speak first means even if you match you are unlikely to keep it for 24 hours
"64120:Mr.Slendykins Sockman,""I met someone that I love and who loves me using this app, I can't thank enough for that. The monetisation side of things however is not as good as Tinder's, I feel like if the bumble membership came with the daily super likes and monthly boost like what Tinder Gold does then that would really get more people using the app, it's much better for finding genuine people as Tinder's mostly filled with people who want meetups."""
"64124:Khaled Dean,""How brain dead must you be to create a dating app where women are the ones that a) make the first move...and b) have 24hrs to make that first move if you match? Stupidest concept ever! Complete waste of time, patience and effort. This is clearly a Tinder clone trying to pull off a gimmick in an attempt to make women feel more at control. Which is the reason why women ALWAYS approach men at clubs and bars. Try harder bumble....SO much harder!!!"""
64165:Pusztai Ferenc,It's way better than Tinder. Why can't download it in Hungary tho?
"64270:Gabriel vB,""Best dating app so far. The fact, that the female has to write first, freshest things up and apparently because of that the woman here have more class than Tinder for instance."""
"64278:raisethe voice,""The developer just following Tinder's rule about payment,that is not going to succesfull this app,why should we go for bumble?no reason. first female move is not a reason to be with bumble. they should make payment amt to keep in mind indian user."""
"64409:Colie Catterson,""Great concept but not nearly enough space for a profile. Interesting to let the ladies make the first move, it might be better to give at least 48 hours to respond. I definitely still enjoy it over Tinder but there are better dating apps out there where you can learn a little more about someone & have time to contact them! Update: I met my boyfriend of 9 months on Bumble & we have an awesome relationship. I also now have a good friend off of BumbleBFF so it's certainly worth a shot!"""
"64423:Byron,""I've tried them all and this app is sorta a fusion between Match and Tinder, but has the best of both worlds and seems to lack the trash found on Tinder. And the fact that women have to make the first move is genius. On other sites you have guys sending 100 thoughtful messages out to no or a few replies and women getting their inboxes flooded so don't even see half the messages they receive. So, Bumble is a win-win."""
64495:Charleston Freeman,Way better than Tinder...
64595:Phu Phillip Trinh,better than Tinder 😂
64610:AJ Erickson,crashes often. boost subscription charges you but doesn't show you likes. Tinder gets a bad rap but at least the App works🤷‍♀️
"64707:Travis Napier,""It's been pretty good, not better than Tinder in my area but that's probably since its not very popular yet."""
"64740:shadeslayer114,""This app kind of seems like a cash grab. They want you to pay for almost everything. A """"bumble coin"""" or whatever it is (super like on tinder) costs $1.99, where as Tinder at least gives you that for free. Also, the 24 hour period to message matches, and where women have to message first, seems a little pointless. Not everyone lives on their phones and people who didn't mean to right swipe can always unmatch as opposed to just waiting out the clock. You also have to pay to extend matches?"""
64761:Shonky Sideways Sam,Much better than Tinder and the matches turn into actual dates.
64764:John Beatty,The app keeps changing my profile picture from the one I select.. tells me I must have a clear pic when I can clearly see I am already providing a clear pic.. very frustrating! Tinder never gave me this issue.
64897:Justin Meyerhofer,Seems like fewer fake accounts than Tinder or POF
64969:Tevin Henderson,App works well. Could use a better profile edititing layout. I feel this is a better version of Tinder. Its kind of a bummer that men cant message first because Ive had matches that never messaged me.So it would be nice to be able to message them at least if we matched. Otherwise this is better than tinder since it seems like less fakes are on here.
65041:Jim Johnny,Better than Tinder
65062:eric Phillips,A lot better than Match or Tinder.
65080:Tom Williams,It's an interesting concept but there's just not enough people on there. I've had many more interesting conversations and more meetups on Tinder than here.
65108:Cells For Cheap,really good app. I'm more refined version of Tinder without the stigma of being used for hookups only.
"65174:Melissa Young,""It's ok, if you're looking for a hook-up. Maybe this is a the new Tinder and no one told me? In 1 week I was asked to hook up by 4 different men. Not helpful when trying to find someone special in a sea of horny turds. It's also pretty lame women have to make the first move. I get that someone has to, but by forcing me to, I resorted to """"hi"""" for every single message."""
65217:Will Frederiksen,The girls aren't as scary and don't ask me about the size of my genitals like on Tinder. I appreciate stricter community standards.
"65239:Joseph Bascetta,""Few matches. Even fewer messages. This app attracts women too timid to pursue a date, or they're also on tinder. They tell you you have matches you'll never see. Their system essentially preys off men by knowing they'll have few matches and showing ones they'll never find swiping in their match queue and drawing in women with a gimics like them messaging first somehow stopping creeps and their corporate paper thin feminist persona. Use Tinder."""
"65351:Laura,""Better than Tinder, but hate the vague time stamps on conversations (they get really confusing)"""
"65461:Brandon Bickham,""I just haven't had any luck on Bumble. It has been a few weeks already. My first few weeks on Tinder I had already had several dates and was having good conversation with several other ladies. Other than the bad luck, I like how the app is set up. Update 7/10/2019: I find it hard to believe that out of all the swiping I do, I have only matched with two users. something is wrong. I match and date with lots of people on other apps...many of which are on Bumble, but I have not matched."""
65478:Mohit Gogia,Better than Tinder.
"65562:PF Productions,""Much better than Tinder in terms of the matching process. The way the profiles are set up & presented give more emphasis to the written details. I got matches the first day I tried Bumble, although Day 2 was not as good. However, the Distance filter is too simplistic for someone living on one side of a major city needing to set a distance great enough to search the opposite side of suburbia, cos it brings up profiles from way OUTSIDE the catchment, which mostly won't be convenient, travel-wise."""
65608:Yadunandan Singh Rawat,Better then Tinder and other dating apps
"65719:Gurjan Oberoi,""They are unnecessarily charging 749/ month. In India, after swiping 20- 30 people, it says 'All caught up.' They should have reduced the prices to attract more people. I would recommend to go for Tinder instead. Don't waste money here unless you are looking for something sophisticated."""
65729:Jose Alfaro,Just use Tinder. This app is a joke.
"65776:Gurdain Singh Madan,""I like it more than Tinder because the ratio of men to women is better i.e. More women, less men. It's convenient to use for men since women make the first move. It's convenient for women since they decide who to message first and don't receive unnecessary messages from men."""
65780:Claudia Tranzow,Fun app much Better than Tinder..
65821:Eric Synoptics,Great app. Better than Tinder.
65839:Marcelo D,Cool concept even that it doesn't always work but that's not the apps fault and at least it isn't a scam like Tinder after the first month.
65917:Rabbabunny Music,it's much better than Tinder. the people are much more friendly. I love how the 24th our thingy works but sometimes I loose pretty awesome matches hehe
"65955:Justin Tam,""Ease of use is ok, but still not as good as Tinder. OKC, etc. Everytime I use this it never works for me. I won't use it again."""
66017:David Moore,More than a hookup ap like Tinder. Better even than some of the paid sites. You have more ability to chat see your messages etc and its free. I really like it.
66086:Everett Allen,This service is higher quality and class than Tinder. And it seems to have a closer balance of men and women.
"66090:Shane Albuquerque,""Quite no of people, but no matches, its quite a dead dating app like Tinder"""
66155:David Hency,It's a lot better than Tinder!
66204:Choked Rat,Just get Tinder.
"66254:L Toledo,""You'll get the picture of you at the range with a gun (even though it's your job) but the girls with every picture having a snapchat filter stay on their profiles. You also have to filter through the """"I only message people who daily extend me"""" or """"I messaged first so you must message me twice, because you're the guy"""" I've only met a few girls that developed to more than just a date. I'll just go back to Tinder."""
"66289:Brian Keller,""The best dating app -- and I've tried Tinder, Hinge, and OKC. The folks seem less skeezy, the format seems to work, and the app itself is solid."""
66313:Jiro Katsutoshi,Great UI and awesome description features compared to Tinder. Just wish I swiped right more haha
66316:Ben Smith,Bumble is way better than Tinder!
66368:Video Gameist,Better Than Tinder
66401:Eric Robertson,I was excited but havent had any matches better off with Tinder you'll have more matches at least
"66413:A Google user,""Tinders better for men, even if marginally In response to your response. You may be assuming I dont know what Im doing. The problem isnt getting matches. The flaw is leaving it to the woman to take initiative. Men initiate the vast majority of sexual/romantic relationships. If you don't think so look it up. It's statistically verified. Therefore you will have less meaningful connections on this app than others. You will waste more time and energy than you usually do on a dating app with Bumble"""
66524:MiddleClass Gear,Better than Tinder
"66588:Travis Webb,""SCAM. DO NOT BUY. Fake Tinder. No Refunds. I tried this out and a few minutes into using it it said I had people who liked my profile. I misread, the price confusing pricr options. I got one ans was suprised it was $86. I decided to go see who the likse wre from. IT WAS BLANK. IT WAS A SCAM. Within 2 minutes I went to the app page to see the removed rhe refund button then emailed them, and they replied No refunds, though its within 48 hours. 5 hours later I am pissed."""
"66598:Chris Shelby,""3 stars for the app concept only. I like the idea of this app but I find that most women still dont want to message first (even when I extend a match) and they let matches expire more often than not. If one does message, I try to engage in conversation but its a few short messages then they ghost. Super swipes are worthless. I though I'd find more mature women here than Tinder but I've had a way better experience there than here. Hopefully other guys have had better luck than I have."""
"66665:Unique Abujarad,""I think that this is just an off brand knock off of Tinder, there are no real connections or true meaning to it, it sucks and I feel bad for the guys who are paying for any service. The time wasted even downloading this horrible app you can meet someone at Starbucks and offer to buy their latte' and 2 double shots of expresso. I have had it and that is why i am creating a new app. A real dating app without all the nonsense, no more fly by nights and fake profiles. Yes men use other guys images too. The app sucks you cant even post pictures of your legs!!!  Whoever created this app must have pencil stick legs with no tan!"""
66682:Christina Salter,I thoroughly have enjoyed my use of Bumble have only encountered 2 creepy people on the Site/App unlike Tinder for example I get 6+ creeps in my inbox or adding my Snapchat but come to recent event I am uninstalling Bumble I've had an amazing experience or I wouldn't have wrote a long review thank you everyone who works for the bumble the great experience! :))
"66718:Mr. Green,""Better than Tinder I'd say. If you're looking for a better chance at something real, and want to engaelge in a place where intentions are a bit more upfront, this is the place. I've had more success on this app than Tinder. I find that people are a lot more honest here. Only think i would say, is that notifications have to be improved. The app only push notifications if the app is open in the background. This could be why some people miss matches."""
66826:Louis Marc,Better interface than Tinder and doesn't spam notifications like Happn.
"66929:Kevin Morris,""I've learned that EVERY female (Which is what Bumble promotes to me) from Romulus, Michigan is a fake profile. Bumble is become the new Tinder with all their fake women profiles"""
66973:Ash Taylor,Getting plenty of matches on Tinder with the same profile yet nothing on here. Clearly they're trying to drive sales. Pay to win. A shame really.
"67103:J N,""Compared to Tinder, Hinge, and OkCupid, this is the inferior dating app. I think there is potential in the format (women message first), however the algorithm that determines who you appear to is poorly designed. I know my profile doesn't suck, I get tons of matches (and dates) using other apps. I've had this for two weeks and only recieved one match. Maybe this is a gimmick to get you to pay for premium features, who knows. Whatever the case, there are vastly better options available."""
"67106:Justin Lemke,""Easy to use, seems more classy than Tinder"""
67115:The Boy Wonder,Hundred times better than Tinder
67149:Vijay Prakash,You're same like Tinder & others apps money minded.. First try to provide access with people.. For everything we have to buy..
"67158:Nameless Data,""APP IS DEAD. Waste of time. Very low public engagement because nobody uses the app. All you get is daily notifications to open the app only to see nothing because its a ghost town. There is a feature to see who """"liked"""" you but it's locked behind a paywall that keeps being pushed on you. These are """"likes"""" from people outside your desireable range and most of them you already swiped left on, so no point paying for something you're not interested in. Somehow they managed to be worse than Tinder"""
"67162:Shea Elsey,""I really liked it at first but like Tinder they don't give you the best filter options and they run out of possible matches after like 15 swipes. When most of those swipes are left, it sucks. Maybe there just aren't many people signing up for their app? I mean I'm smack in the middle of 2 large cities Austin and Waco. And the world largest Army base. You'd think there would be a lot more people joining in my area."""
"67253:Dustin Hambrick,""It's like Tinder, but better. As a man it's refreshing to have the women make the first move."""
67307:Bee Bee,better than POF and Tinder
67407:Hank Ceballos,I have Tinder and a couple of other apps. Bumble had better looking girls and better quality girls
67434:Michael Robbins,It has cuter girls than Tinder but works mostly the same.
"67445:Sas Vassie,""Well it does what it saying on the tin. You post your pics, you swipe and get likes, you say something random before the sodding app starts poking you and 50% of guys reply back. No different from Tinder except the number of pathetic f*ckboys seems to be about half. Bumble! Sort out your sodding notifications. If I have every notification turned OFF except messages received I do not expect to receive your absolute drivel nagging me to message people, telling me who's online etc. Ffs!"""

"68106:Rain,""This is a pretty good dating app honestly. The people I've met thus far have all been really genuine and lowkey I've found more mature guys who are actually looking for a relationship on here, whereas Tinder you'll find more people just trying to bang."""
"68141:Clay Cook,""Completely sexist profile picture policy. Tons of girls with bikini profile pics, yet it wont let me have a profile picture of me in a swimming suit. If I can't show off my hard work on my body then this app is not for me. Tinder still reigns supreme."""

68452:TJ Connell,had an issue with my account/payments and reached out on Twitter. Bumble responded promptly amd resolved the issue within 2 days. They were polite and actually refunded an amount. what a pleasant suprise to find a social giant actually care and try to help you. these folks are everything Tinder is NOT. All my stars if I could.
68487:Sridhar Venkatesh,It's got a much better interface and system than Tinder.
68585:Colton Carey,Better than Tinder imo
68589:simon nixon,I committed to 1 day of service just to try it and was charged for three months. contacted Bumble and they said sorry tough luck kid even though it was less then 24 hrs after I signed up.This is some scum baggery going on here. save your money and get Tinder or something.
"68867:William Murray,""This app sucks. They want women to message you first but when you match with one, she won't message you at all. So just like Tinder, this app is full of bots. Terrible app. Abhorrent design. Laughable quality. Don't waste your time with this malarkey"""
69002:Brodrick Lyles,Better than Tinder
"69012:Kai Gillespie,""Matches are super rare, conversations even more so. HUGE waste of time for any guy. PoF has better results, even after ignoring all the bots. Best option, stick to Tinder."""
"69041:Mas Queey,""I really like this dating app! It allows you to set your preferences admit which people you'd want to date and show others what you're looking for. Also by enforcing a conversation to start within 24 hours, it makes sure you get matches that actually want to talk with you. It also has a much friendlier and personal feel than Tinder. The only downside is that there just aren't as many people on here as there are on Tinder, it only takes you about a day to get through everyone in your region."""
"69063:Max Kemper,""So after pretty sub-par experiences with Tinder, I had high hopes for Bumble, mainly due to their selling point of the girls making the first move. However, to my disappointment it turned out to be just another Tinder. After swiping on one to three people, it will tell you that you need to wait for more to show up, which typically takes until the next day. And the people who have liked your profile can of course only be viewed if you get a subscription. Yet another cash grab, what a shame."""
"69111:Franz,""this app used to be cool. now it's just another Tinder copycat with premium restrictions. did Bumble get bought or something? what's next, 50 swipes limit per day? u guys really dropped the ball here."""
"69220:Aaron Harrington,""So far it seems better than Tinder. The algorithm seems so much more fluid, then again I've only recently joined and that's how it usually goes upon first creating accounts on such apps. Seems like a better app though in terms of smoothness and detail."""
69223:Jack Holguin,Good for meeting beautiful women and better that Tinder
69451:Jenny Klingler,this app is head-and-shoulders over Tinder as far as finding people that are serious about a relationship
69481:Charlie De Los Santos,i singed up for a free trial of their subscriptions and got no notification or was it in my subscription section on tue playstore and have been being charged $2.99 for weeks and hagevdeleted the app a while ago.The cancel subscription option in such small text its barley noticeable which is very scummy of them because i had to look clsoely just to see it. I wont even try to contact customer care because I highly doubt ill get a refund. Stick to Tinder or another dating app this app is a scam.
69526:Katie Rice,Bumble is overall a great app! definitely prefer it to Tinder. I love that you can say you are looking for a relationship so you can immediately weed out the people who aren't looking for anything serious.
69595:Marcos Castellanos,I have more luck on Tinder there's more people on there bumble bee websites kind of boring I swipe through for 5 people then I won't get nothing or another 3 days 2
69625:Surjit Chohan,They dont allow you enough time to meet someone and niay professionals need more time to connect rather than 24 to 48 hours. They charge a mot but dont deliver ots a Nusiness Model the less time you give people to connect the more money they make. Boooo.Back to Tinder or OKC.
69672:Nikolai,A good dating app. Worth using. Higher quality than Tinder.
"69747:Scott Broadbent,""It's pretty sad when you get more matches on Tinder... literally, after months of being on here I had all of one match and they couldn't be bothered to say hello. Constantly getting notifications to try to draw me back. If you're not one of the 20% of men who get most of the attention, you probably will be disappointed with this."""
69752:Ichiroo,limited swipe even the swipe left still counted i wondered why!? we stan Tinder ftw!
69754:Garry B,An app that reduces dating to a complete meat market. It's just deciding if you like someone solely from a single image. Tinder is less inherently superficial than this.
69901:erin matthews,better than Tinder
69909:Philip Bogachuk,Just a waste of time. My advice to people is to try Tinder or Hinge. Much better chances of meeting someone. Bumble sucks!
69919:Mario Miranda,better than Tinder
"69928:Jonathan Harrington,Better than the Tinder scam app. Innovative concept (ladies first) separates it from the pack. Generally pretty Progressive -- they banned gun nuts from showing pics of their surrogate wieners. Women may still experience unwanted photos; men may experience blackmail attempts by scammers (happened only once in my use of the app)."
"69976:Aubrey Kapree,""Pretty sure Bumble doesn't work. I swiped right to several dozen over the past couple days and have gotten only 2 matches. So, I try Tinder and I got 2 matches in 5 minutes. You guys at Bumble should look into this. Many people seem to be complaining about not getting matches, so clearly this isnt a coincidence."""
69982:Supa kith,better than Tinderr 👌🏻

70081:Prim Baxter,This app is so much better than Tinder if your not looking for a hook up.
"70111:Erin,""I apparently have a bunch of matches, but can only see two. Makes it really hard to make the first move within the 24 hour window I'm given. From what the other reviews say, this is a blatant money grab. Back to Tinder I go."""
70119:Bryce Carson,The app is actuslly coded well. Tinder & OkCupid run like garbage.
70120:Crimson Marauder,Bumble is practically Tinder on hard mode. Also when it notifies me that i got a like nothing shows up on my queue. This has happened multiple times. It should be noted that I am paying for the service as well.
"70139:Maciej Cierkosz,""Bumble as a dating platform is pretty good and innovative. Better rules than on Tinder. Also it's creators are not as greedy - using it without premium features does not impair or impact the experience. I think in this regard that's the best dating service on the market here, in Ireland. So why three stars You ask? Unfortunately as an app Bumble needs fixes. The most irritating thing - notifications. Even though I saw all the messages from some people app continues to notify me! Please fix that!"""
70148:Travis Stone,haha I went from getting nothing on Tinder to getting lots of messages on bumble.
70161:Karthik Gathu,A good app with an amazing logic of matching. unlike Tinder the user profiles look much detailed.
"70198:Ricky Ricardo,""It's a good dating app (certainly much better than Tinder) and I like the features like being able to backtrack and having profiles based on questions. The idea of having to chat within 24 hours is nice in theory, but it doesn't really seem to fix there being a ton of matches who just never respond. My biggest complaint is that once you're out of matches you rarely get any more and the ones you do get are people who haven't swiped on you."""
70240:Ayush Mishra,Better than Tinder.
"70402:Steven Rogers,""I know it's a coincidence that I met my future wife on Bumble, but it's still cool. I had previously tried Match, eHarmony, OkCupid, Tinder, and a few others. I had one serious relationship via Tinder. I thought I'd end up with her, but she broke up with me. I deleted Tinder and then had fun dates via OkCupid. It was fine, but then I found Bumble. Didn't pay anything (unlike Match and Tinder). We got engaged March 23, 2019! I'd rank them: Bumble, OkC, Tinder... and everything else tied for last."""
70436:Kelly Nuñez Tozzi,very similar to Tinder
70469:Komal Bayati,Horrible app. Gives you 10 swipes a day unless you pay their ridiculous prices. I've been with 230 girls but I can't get a match on Bumble to save my life. That's because everyone on Bumble is white and are looking for white guys. They need to promote diversity on this app or something. Tinder is more inclusive and I've probably met 10-15 girls on there.
70485:Ashley Wragg,Good overall experience. The users seem to have a higher standard than your Typical Tinder users.
70497:Roller Simmer,I love Bumble. Better than Tinder.
70550:K Jay,definitely a more mature vibe than Tinder.
70554:Natasha Arksey,Better pool of fish than Tinder.
"70709:Gary Lucich,""The app has a decent interface at surface level. However, a series of small issues (badge notifications appearing without corresponding in-app activity, non-existent match rates in current version and location versus previous) emerged. I messaged Bumble three separate times to hopefully address the issues, and I never received a response. Turns out that the email address that they use for non-apple product feedback doesn't work- all three emails were returned. Now I have to resort to Tinder."""
"70753:david cervantes,""No matches, a lot of spam accounts. just as bad as Tinder"""
70880:TaIsKing,Better than Tinder
"70903:In Human Creation Media,""Made a few new friends. People are much better communicators here, than on Tinder."""
70937:manas ranjan,It was better before. Way better than Tinder. But the latest update has just spoiled everything. The app has become too slow and is not working at all. Even on 4g and wifi. Complete opposite to what it was before.
"71233:Harley Road Glide,""1. This app use to be so good, now it's getting worse than Tinder. I have tried to see if this app is """"cheating the system"""" by swiping on people I know, them doing the same and waiting for the match that never comes. I get RANDOM matches to people I've never even seen. and 2. This app allows so many fake accounts, it's not even worth updating."""
"71342:Nik Bistro,""The apps connection is absolutely terrible. It will cut out randomly, not update conversations and more. I know it is not my phones connection as I have already verified if it was. I just downloaded the app and had recieved a bunch of possible matches in the Match Que. I closed the app, reopened and all of them were gone! Emailed customer support asking what happened and recieved a generic response. This app needs a lot of work and I am glad I spent no money on it. Tinder is far superior."""
71354:J F,Worst app ever. Went from being able to use it to not being able to use it at all anymore a week after. Even the facebook page support is horrible my account was linked to my FB now it says something went wrong try again!! It is same message when Tinder did it to me. I swear internet privacy laws for dating sites are horrible should just bring back old fashion dating instead of these garbage hook-up apps.
"71364:Adam,""Only been on for two days and have gotten many matches and most of the girls sent messages. Seems like a good app, like the layout better than Tinder or POF!"""
"71478:Isiah Hilton,""I like Bumble over Tinder because the setup is much more in depth. You can break it all down instead of reading one giant bio like on Tinder. I also like the little symbols that represent various parts of your life such as what type of engagement you're looking for, if you have or want children, your religion, tour political status, etc. Plus Bumble is more creative, diverse. I also like the idea of the ladies getting the messaging rights so they can't be harassed for no reason."""
"71529:Isaac Orah,""I have been on Bumble for over a week, my account is even verified but I have had only one match that I couldn't even chat with because I'm a guy. In the same duration of time and with a similar profile on Tinder, I have had over 30 matches and met one person for a date. I actually like the aesthetic appearance of Bumble but it hasn't proven to be functional yet. Whats the point of a dating app where you cant meet people? Also, the rule that women must make the first move is sexist towards men."""
"71536:Art3mis,""Seems to attract a better group of people than Tinder. The only thing I didn't like is that it shows the exact city I'm in, rather than the distance. Had a few creepy conversations because of it. You can see matches if they've also swiped right, though not EVERYONE who's liked your profile unless you pay. I didn't have any problems with bugs in the app, though apparently my last attempt at leaving a review got deleted."""
"71544:N. Taylor,""Would be nice if you could turn off your location in the app, but still find matches in the area you are in. Fyi, Tinder has this option..."""
"71578:Clive Baxter,""So far so good. I like the concept and I hope they do more to make it more effective and differentiate themselves more from Tinder. This is very important, because Tinder is (or has become) a failing disaster. I have more faith in Bumble."""
"71591:Will,""I've recieved plenty of matches on Tinder Hinge and even Bumble. However Bumble really makes you work for it in the form of a swipe marathon. This app is probably pretty solid for the female side because they match first and they seem very serious about protection. my advice is download Hinge. Classier women and it's less fake compared to Bumble or Tinder. Dear Bumble, step your game up because your app sucks!"""
"71653:Michelle Smith,""I heard about this app through a close friend and thought I'd give it a go. I've always been against dating apps, especially Tinder as it appears to be primarily about """"getting laid"""". So, I thought I'd give Bumble a go. What I didn't expect was to fall in love with the first person I went on a date with. We hit it off on our first date and now are planning on getting married next year. Thank you so much Bumble, you've changed our lives forever 🥰"""
"71665:Matt Hjorth,""Their photo moderation is ridiculous, pic of you and your nephew? No. You and your dog? No. Doing a little yoga? No. On a horse? No. On a motorbike? No. Tried so many photos that were auto deleted I gave up. Stick to Tinder, much easier format"""
71751:Anuj Kumar,This should be more popular than Tinder. It has better filtering and genuine people.
"71764:Alex Chadsey,""It functions like it's supposed to, and has a decent design. I mainly use it for the dating side, so I can't really say how the 'bff' and 'professional' bits work. The thing that stands out to me is the fact that women message men first, which helps to challenge a whole bunch of problematic social norms. It's basically a more progressive Tinder. The only thing that keeps me from giving it five stars is the lack of space for writing bios. But that might be an intentional thing based on research."""
71770:jonnynace,Better than Tinder.
"71899:Matt Bernier,""Well, it's not Tinder."""
"71902:Derek Carpenter,""The worst dating app I've used thus far. Distances are inaccurate and dont account for actual traffic. Matches never contact first or respond after making contact. Having to pay to see potential matches is just a money grab for the makers and not worth the money for what you get in return. Matches expire far too soon for people to contact or communicate. Overall its just a shittier version of Tinder, and I'd give it a 1/5. Its not worth your time."""
71963:Trini Mac,I like Bumble better than most other dating apps. its certainly a way better alternative to Tinder. The guys are more respectful because they know their accounts will be deleted if they're rude. women do have to make first contact but guys can decided to respond or not. There are lots of possible matches. the only thing I would say is maybe give people 48 hrs to respond to a match. life is busy sometimes!
71968:Donovan Naidoo,the interface and overall app is great to use.Its fairly simple to get going. However the point of the app is dates of which I have had zero. It seems you need to pay to get any benefit and the profiles on this app seems like they were copied and pasted from another dating site. These profiles dont seem active at all. Which is a shame. I prefer this apps approach over Tinder but I have had dates there without having to pay.Disappointed. My profile is pretty good so it makes no sense. Zero matches
"72031:Christopher Forbus,""Bit the bullet and paid the $10 to actually see the people who matched with me, the app then told me I hadn't paid and needed me to pay again even though I have the emailed receipt. Put in multiple support tickets asking for help and received none nor can I even ask for a refund. Moving on to a different app or trying Tinder again."""
"72039:Summer A. W.,""Met a lot of douchebags using women for sex or mommy with no career, no ambition, no apt, no forethought, but plenty of 🍆. They'll even show you thanks to the app's photo feature! Also only app I've encountered fakes or prostitutes on, & I had to make the first move for all of that. It's like it's designed for the guys taking care of too lazy to talk to women before sex on Tinder, just want to rake em in. If that's what you're looking for, cool. Not into rapey dates? Not the app for you."""
72164:Brian James Ferguson,way better than Tinder
72252:Brett Murray,Bumble has some interesting improvements and additions to other apps like Tinder that have a pretty positive impact on the overall experience.
72310:John LSX454,You only get matches if you pay. Tinder is better
"72373:Geo L,""this app is worse than Tinder, but they're both trash. $80 for 6 month. No Refund."""
"72402:ZC,""This is like the better form of Tinder. Ways for people to clearly identify themselves, and people focused in relationships"""
72413:Andries Groenenberg,Basically Tinder but with questions that it asks you about yourself. Works nicely but sends way too many push notifications about stuff you don't care about ended up uninstalling because ads from the app where getting annoying.
"72427:Todd Smith,""The ponzi scheme of dating apps. Seems like a simple version of Tinder yet seems like there is 0 activity on the females side... That and we all the female members models? Odd and suspicious.. Seems entirely robotic or full of inactive profiles. Who would waste their money on extending a unactive profile? Terrible, I can't believe this makes tinder look amazing."""
72446:Matt Williams,Bumble experience is better than Tinder
"72512:D&D Towing Transport,""cuz the girl will match with you but not actually message you.. I like Tinder better, you can send a message if you match"""
72621:Brittany Widmann,Honestly so much better then Tinder
72629:Tony Salas,Been on it for several months girls are more stuck up on here than on Tinder. Tinder has been much more enjoyable...
"72639:Sitanshu Mehrotra,""In all honesty, Bumble has been a much better experience than Tinder. The Quality of Matches(people you get matched to) is at a different level. Though like Tinder, the frequency drops if you're not a regular."""
72664:ayush sethi,Looking forward to mentioning Bumble as an app better than Tinder.
72712:David Carden,It works. Had matches and dates. Seems better than Tinder at what it does (less Instagrammers)
72839:BEE HOMES,More options than Tinder
"72877:Karl Calixto Acosta,""It's actually much better than i thought. I think it's better than most apps out there like POF or Tinder. I'm already meeting real people, so...Bumble actually works. Just don't be creepy once you get a message or if you don't get any at all; maybe there's something wrong with your profile. Re-read it and be yourself."""
72955:Patrick,Much better than Tinder.
"73031:Kimmo Halonen,""Better than Tinder, I just wish more people used it."""
"73112:A Google user,""Easy to use. Lots of profiles to browse through. I just don't like the messaging with this app, when compared to Tinder and other like dating apps."""
73132:Used by Google,Always lagging. I have to close app then restart again. Conversations are a pain as it does this all th time. Screen freezes or just a loading screen. Cant refresh page. Cant see msg. All of these happen everytime i go on bumble. I deleted it. Tinder all the way. The whole idea of women texting first is stupid anyway. It doesnt work honestly. Ive givin this app plenty of chances. Bye bumble.
"73145:Shashank Kaushik,""Good app. Better than Tinder. The only thing that makes it horrible, is the fact that you cannot text first and this ultimately leads to not being able to interact with someone you might actually have a chance with. why would someone pay for your services and premium features if they aren't even allowed to make the first move?"""
"73176:Marianna Robles,""It's not horrible, I just don't like being the one to have to make the first move. It's very similar to Tinder."""
"73187:Sean Scott,""after two years of Tinder I was absolutely done with online dating. Then a friend had try Bumble and I loved it! instead of being just one of the hundred new messages a girl receives it's on her to respond. this may seem like a small change but it truly changes the game. you can gain so much insight by someone's first response! from a simple """"hey"""" which could indicate low interest to the more extensive greeting to show they're taking the time & effort for you♡ don't give up on love! just Tinder"""
"73256:Kamil A.,""Was Best swiping interface, until Tinder upgraded theirs. For some reason this one has a lot of hot women compared to others. The bad news is that it's very hard to get any matches, and when you do, they are not followed up on. But it may just be because I'm not willing to put too much personal info on there like my job. I NEED A SKIP BUTTON! WHY IS EVERYONE FORCING ME TO CHOOSE?!!"""
"73317:Brad Knapp,""The quality of people in general is a little bit better on Bumble, and since the girl has 24 hours to message you, it usually leads to messaging if you match, unlike Tinder. However, Bumble is CONSTANTLY sending notifications to my phone, ads pop up with my native Text app sound on my notification bar, it will """"remind"""" me 2-3 times a day to use Bumble. It seems like every time I bring it up, I'm asked to enter EVEN MORE information about myself before I can start swiping."""
"73321:Kahlin Walker,""DO NOT GET THIS! Similar to Tinder, this app will tell you that you have a like/match that you can't view without paying and as soon as you purchase their """"coins,"""" the like/match goes away. On top of being ripped off, you also have to sort through numerous fake profiles and scammers. Although the other functions of this app may be useful, the dating portion is a scam and I do not say that often, unless your Tinder or Coffee Meets Bagel then I do say that haha! Seriously, don't use those either."""
73333:marc chinama,To me better than Tinder. Tinder has too many fake profiles.
"73356:Kristofer Thompson,""Much better than Tinder. Love they priortize the order of people shown. Also much less buggy. Now if only everyone would understand the rules of women having to contact first, all would be lovely 😊"""
73357:Tyler Stanley,Great app. Much better than Tinder. Foh wit dat weaksauce.
73431:priyanka bidari,Much better than Tinder.
"73478:Ben Shearer,""Used it previously and have met people courtesy of it. Due to women having to make the first move it will help whittle out the nobhead guys as they're busy harassing on Tinder etc. It's ridiculous that guys are downvoting because they don't get many matches; how is it Bumble's fault if you aren't an eye-catcher? Either keep going, or try a more personality based dating app (Hinge for instance) or do something about it to be the best you you can be 🤷🏻‍♂️"""
73548:A Google user,Decent app seemedly full of decent people. I would recommend it over Tinder.
73693:Gaurav Bansal,Perfect channel to meet a mate... Very genuine people around unlike Tinder
73817:A Google user,Definitely much better than Tinder in letting girls talk first.
"73846:Conner Phillips,""Better than Tinder, except it's underpopulated so not as effective."""
73882:Thandi Dube,Better than Tinder
73897:Javier Jaimes,forget about Tinder
73967:Lewis Kitney,Women match but dont message. Seems pointless. Tinder is better.
73981:A Google user,So far this has been a good experience. Definitely different than the Tinder and the semi instant gratification. Notifications for receiving messages could be way better. I don't want an alert 5 hours later for a message I received 8 hours ago.
"74015:Dylan Haas,""Better than Tinder, mostly because im not interested in hooking up with strangers."""
"74037:Darius Firoz,""it takes long to meet anyone, it's a longer version of Tinder where girls choose to talk first. it's a good idea, but still needs a tweak. too many girls on here looking for nothing, it needs to be more selective I think"""
74093:Brian T.V.,lots of fun! the only other dating app that competes with Tinder! imo
74099:Dawson Douglas,Not as obnoxious as Tinder.
"74110:A Google user,""People rarely write enough on their profile for you to get a feel for their personalities or interests - and without something there to connect to, why swipe right? The app seems dull, neither as fluid as Tinder or as detailed as OKC."""
74231:Zach M,It's like Tinder but better.
74307:Bob Snow,Much better than Tinder
"74380:Michael Hoselton,""No criteria/matching features, very limited profile, so it gives a very Tinder/hook up vibe. Only women can send messages, but only have 24 hours to do it, so you'll almost never talk to anyone. Surprising number of profiles used the limited space to indicate their desire to murder public employees."""
74475:A Google user,it is some what better then Tinder
"74489:Phillip Trottier,""I gave them a 1* Review based off my previous experience; after consideration, I've revised my opinion to include their support staffs assistance. I'd be willing to give 4* upon further improvements to the app down the road, but current valuation seems appropriate. TL;DR Bumble > Tinder"""
"74496:Stuart K,""i used bumble for less than a week. As an app, I'd rate it a bit higher than Tinder. I liked the expanded profiling. I will say that I am pretty sure I was matched with someone I didn't swipe right on but can't be certain. For a platform designed specifically to empower women and encourage respect? Meh. The users did the opposite for me. Aside from the expanded profiling, no real difference compared to tinder."""
"74555:A Google user,""As a man it's cool to not have to be the one to make the first move for a change, questioning sometimes whether or not the woman is even into me. Bumble takes the guess work out, and the constant """"hey how's it going"""" we face as dudes on other sites, and it's less likely for your messages to get buried like on Tinder. If you 2 match, she has 24 hours to hit you up first... because she wants and chooses to. It's fun and nice to be pursued. Just be friendly and respectful."""
"74628:Kevin Hogan,""Pros: free service, user friendly like Tinder but unlike Tinder has fundamental questions suggests people answer outside their bio like whether or not want kids or have kids, etc. Cons: The few questions are all optional but in my opinion important for filtering interests, some write very little in their bio. Like other dating sites you sometimes get matches who only wanna chat but not go out on date kinda defeats the purpose."""
"74666:A Google user,""This app is garbage, really. The time limits destroy its usefulness. Got a few dates out of it but far less than any other dating app. Tinder is by far the better option."""
74688:A Google user,Definitely better than Tinder!
74743:pablo espinal,Pretty good app. Specifically for me it's better than Tinder and other dating apps available
"74772:A Google user,""Terrible application. Once you register they bait you into spending money to buy premium to see who has has already liked you and it turns out to be a bot/moderator. Spend 2 days Litterly just liking every single woman, not a single match. Downloaded Tinder and oh look within 10min I was already talking to a woman who is not only within 3 miles from me, but also is not a moderator or a bot. I'm not sure if the app is just buggy or full of dead accounts. Won't ever use it again. 🤷‍♂️"""
74796:Grizz_ 567,Constant notifications begging for money. Greedy and money hungry developers. Don't waste your time .Download Tinder if anything.

"75008:Ian Williams,""Little more than Tinder with more info, but men arent allowed to take initiative in an online space where women refuse to do the same."""
75078:A Google user,I like it a lot more than Tinder. People seem to be more interested in dating than hooking up. They've ironed out the bugs from the last time I tried installing the app.
75159:Otto de Jesus,Girls are friendlier here than Tinder. Had a couple of snobby one but they're blocked now lol.
75376:Osama Madlom,Decent alternative to Tinder.
75382:Austin Sanders,I've talked to so many people and have had great results. Even if we dont talk after the app they have all been kind and respectful and an actual real sincere person. This is better than Tinder for sure!
"75636:Richard Morley,""I like this site. It has a nice interface, and I especially like that it puts women in the driving seat in initiating conversation. Seem to be a nice range of people on it too...mire respectable than Tinder!"""
"75639:A Google user,""Better than Tinder, i see a lot of complaints about people not responding. You get that on all of the platforms. I like ladies talk first as finally there's a bit of equality 👍and it makes Bumble stand out from the rest. I also like the 24hr limit on a match, some will use it like tinder and play the game of averages. I don't pay for the app and i still get matches, chats and dates. If you get a notification someone has matched, then it disappears, chances are they have deleted you from match"""
"75745:Michael Cruce,""Bumble isn't that bad of an app. They make it easy for shy guys like me who likes women, because women has to make the 1st move, unless you are a homosexual. Then you or the person can message 1st.They also arent as bias as Tinder in regards of political view differences, unless you upload a meme bashing feminism then they will give you a warning and then delete the meme photo or what you wrote in your profile about it. If I had more matches I would of gave them 5 stars. Forget Tinder use this."""
75786:Aaron Heaney,Keep running out of people to swipe on even though the app says i have several people who have liked me. After two weeks I am yet to find match with these people. Whats the point of this app if they allow people to like you but prevent them some showing in your searches so you can match unless you pay to see them of course. Its a pay to win mechanic and it sucks in a dating app. Tinder is terrible but at least you match and talk to people on it easily.
"75838:broken glasses,""The app let girls to do the talk first if they're interesting in you, so if they just accidentally liked you and you got matched, she could avoid you even if you extended chat time. Got a match before in like months but failed and never another second match, a lot less than on Tinder and CMB"""
75860:Dharmesh Parmar,Very similar to Tinder... Dunno whats really different... But a nicely developed app and not a cheap rip off... Hope gives a few better features soon

75952:Becca Lacroix,Trash! Complete trash! Tinder is free. If you wanna get ANYWHERE on this app you have to pay. Switching back to tinder!
76080:Josue Diaz,Awesome app. Seems like the Tinder crowd migrated over to Bumble. Theres a ton of activity. Haven't noticed any spam accounts. Easy to use.
"76197:Ariel Johnston,""Ive been on bumble before and i liked it more than Tinder. I deleted my account and returned a month later making a new account. Also went back on my tinder.

I will be deleting this app."""
"76308:Edward Harmon,""I like that there are filters, unlike Tinder, as well as more detailed profiles. It's a bit exhausting as a male in an already small dating pool (polyamorous) to swipe a bunch when you know most won't be interested. I don't like that the super-like button bounces. It makes me think there's one available like Tinder's daily one, but it just brings up the shop."""
76394:Garritt Harris,it's better than Tinder
"76474:Chris Moes,""App is easy to use. Profile is easy to set up. I like that you can verify your account, feel like there are fewer bots than Tinder. Why is distance at the very bottom? It sucks to get to the bottom of a girl's profile and find out I've got an hour+ of driving if I want to get a cup of coffee. Distance to the top and it would be 5 stars. I dont use the paid features, so I cannot comment on how well they work, or if they are worth the money."""

76699:christopher roberts,The search algorithm for bumble is awful. It does not display the people who have liked to leaving you to swipe for hours with no results. Tinder has a far better algorithm. The paid service would allow you to see the likes but it's grossly overpriced. Overall quite a poor app. Changing the algorithm to show those who liked you first would fix things.
"76720:Doug Kautenberger,""Better UI and fewer bugs than Tinder. My only complaint would be that it feels bloated with inactive accounts which just makes it a tad annoying. Otherwise, an enjoyable experience."""
76734:Ariel G,a million times better than Tinder
76769:Pinky Garcia,I like the way it's set up compared to Tinder :)
76795:Phillip Hutton,I've tried match and tinder. by far this is the dating app that gets the most serious chicks to talk to you. Tinder inundates the chicks with messages. They literally have no time to check the messages. With bumble the ones really interested reach out to you. So you know they are interested in you.
76797:Marcus Aurelius,better than Tinder
76848:Rachel Dyer,this is so much better than Tinder. people can give more information about themselves. the 24 hour limit stops people from swiping for instant gratification. I've been able to have better matches and conversation this way. no harassment yet. does need improvement in some areas but otherwise better than most other apps.
76906:A Google user,Tinder is in trouble!
76943:Prasanna Lakshmi,I found same list of profiles from Tinder so Its disappointing. Most of them are married folks looking for hookup.
"76979:JoshxDarnxIt,""This app works fine, but I get significantly fewer interactions in it than I do from Tinder."""
"77013:A Google user,""For some reason, Bumble doesn't have a non-binary gender option and limits how often you can change your gender. And the verification process seemed to struggle with my photos before finally going through, but now the verification got reversed. Otherwise, this app has a better feel overall in contrast to Tinder. I feel like I'll experience less toxicity here. I'll use Bumble for my masc days and Tinder femme days."""
77030:Gabriel Diaz,Don't waste your time. An app based on ideology that woman will initiate contact. They don't. We are different. This app proves it. I get matches on Tinder every day. I wonder who lost all their money on this destined to fail app

Tinder loads images in 1/10th the time). Thank you."""
77325:Nathan Frantz,Hotter girls than Tinder
77350:Camille Scarlett,This app is HORRIBLE. I was accused of being a catfish even though my pictures were verified and BUMBLE permanently banned my account. They straight up banned me from finding the love of my life. So many cute guys on there that needed a little love from the snack that is me! Now bumble has robbed these men the chance at true happiness and Bliss all because they are haters!! Worse app ever behind Tinder.
"77358:Anant Jain,""completely useless, if you can't see the massage sent by your match within 24 hours, they'll not allow the user to even see the profile of the match and demands a paid package just to open the profile, bumble shouldn't be this much money minded in the initial stages, I am a gold user of tinder. I can see a very less chances of sustainability of this app, and it stands nowhere if somebody compares it with Tinder. deleting it"""
77445:Queen Cecelia,Better quality men than Tinder.
77447:A Google user,It was just like Tinder. But you have the choice to talk to someone or not.
"77482:Jacob Marten,""It's Tinder without all of the thots and players. There are actual decent people on here that are actually looking for a variety of relationships. You can search potential matches with relevant filters, women have to message first (which gets rid of that whole """"impress me with a joke or I'll unmatch you"""" game), and so much more. It's what Tinder should have been. The only downside is that premium costs more than on Tinder, but it is also less necessary to match with cool people."""
77492:Nicholas Herrington,it's nice talking to real girls as opposed to the huge amount of bots you come across on POF. also the fact that the chick has to initiate the conversation is awesome. so much better than Tinder where you can have all kinds of matches and not once speak to any of them
77500:Ashwin Kumar,i like it better than Tinder
77566:Aidan O'Reilly,Best dating app. Way better than PoF and more successful than Tinder
77589:Harry Fryer,It's... OK. It's a good idea in theory with one fatal flaw: nobody uses it. Tinder is ultimately the only dating app people actually check and use. The fact that the girl has to message first only adds to people not responding or using it. It's a shame.
"77591:Jon Snow,""Better than tinder by far, pretty good idea as a dating app to have women message first, however the time limits on conversations ruin many many potential connections. There should be a 48 hr time limit or even a week, not 24hrs. For people saying there are 'fake' people on here who dont talk, i havent run into NEARLY as many on Bumble compared to Tinder which is chalk full of dummy profiles and women who dont ever respond. Another pro: Bumble always seems to ve adding features and improving."""
"77596:Ken Hinson,""It's a RIP off!!! Scammed me out 79.99, no refunds, no prorated refunds. Don't do it. All the same people on Tinder. Never again!!!"""
77641:A Google user,I like this app way better than Tinder or POF.
77657:Rave DeGrave,Ugly. Girls are ugly. Barely ever message. Doesn't even come close to Tinder.
77660:Shubham Sharma,it actually works. better than Tinder which is so over rated and gets no matches at all. Good work team Bumble! :)
"77684:Coco Joelyneé,""Fraudster guys on Tinder from 5 years ago. they claim to make it """"safe"""" yet every guy I matched wanted to come to my house! Really? hadn't used the app a full week. Also, if this is so safe why do guys lie about their lifestyle and occupation? basically, if your smart and pretty there will always be Haters. Next... ok developers, you gave me the same response. I think you kicked me off because those guys were caught in minutes of their fraudulent activity."""
"77686:Eric Crossley,""Unlimited likes, probably better than Tinder"""
77753:Antoine M,Bumble should let you share profiles like Tinder.
"77756:Erik Heiser,""Don't use Tinder. Bumbe is classy, without the bots and scammers. Puts control in the women's hands so they're comfortable. No real complaints from me. The only dating app I use now, but I'm yet to get a date from it."""
"77793:A Google user,""The UI/UX of this app is far better than many of the other dating apps I have tried. Paired with that, I have had a bit more luck holding conversations with matches, as they have to initiate. Overall, better than Tinder."""
"77802:Adventurous Covers,""This app is easy to use and not so """"pay for dates"""" like Tinder has turned into"""
"77839:Suzanne Pearson,""So far it has been worth switching from Tinder. The quality of possible partners are higher and most men are actually looking for a partner, not a one night stand."""
"77849:Kyle Refinski,""It's better than Tinder. Bumble only forced women to say 'hi' first. After initial greetings, the male must carry the conversation."""

77975:Kaye lucas-kavanaugh,this app has gotten much better. I love the fact that you can send pictures which you cannot do in Tinder. I can unmatched if someone is being not decent! I haven't had any glitches and if I have to uninstall and log in super easy to get back in as if I had never left!
77981:Raechelle McLean,It's not Tinder...why do they bother trying for 'hookups'. App tweaks out and messages are delayed. Repeats matches.
77990:Vivek Varendra,It is better than Tinder but now I'm trying to reinstall the app and I can't! Is anybody else having the same problem?
"77999:Zak Quor,""I had Tinder for 5 years and got jack-all matches, even fewer conversations, and even much fewer dates (like 3 total). Had Bumble for a week and so far I'm talking to a few different people and the conversations are going well. Having the onus on the woman to make the first move is what really sets it apart from other online dating platforms and is great for breaking gender enforced roles."""
"78010:Jon Latane,""Has lots of bugs. Even the bug reporting is broken and doesn't work! UI isnt very responsive. Go with Tinder, CMB or Hinge - they're far better!"""
78142:A Google user,This app is a joke of a concept. It is exactly the same as Tinder for all intents a purposes only with a less egalitarian principal and less people. Just don't bother.
78165:Danielle,DO NOT PAY FOR THE UPGRADE. I pay to see who swipes right on me & it's so annoying that it only allows you to see 11 Match Queues at a time. If you want to see your other matches then you have to manually and individually go through each profile to decline them. Tinder has a better system.
"78231:Ryan St Louis,""Notifications for texts don't work, and half of the matches I get are bots. In order to text someone, verification should be mandatory. Tinder has been more useful then this app for friends and dates."""
78268:Spc_Munguia,Tinder's rejects. Lots of angry liberal woman and single moms.
78277:A Google user,Women have VERY little experience starting a conversation. Majority if not overwhelming majority will only write Hi or Hey and then expect you to take it from there. So Bumble is hardly different than Tinder whose co-founder started Bumble.
78292:A. Sharma,They have managed to make something worse and more useless than Tinder and we have to applaud them for that
78307:Ian Burt,Better than Tinder. Has more options for customizing your profile. Just signed 2 days ago and i've already had matches and conversations.
78355:Johnny Rocket,Worked exactly as described. I managed to match with way more quality women than Tinder. I have since uninstalled Tinder. Bumble finally came through for me. Thank you Bumble.
78398:TacticalDoeBoy .1,Better than Tinder.
"78502:A Google user,""These dating apps are all the same. They hold your admirers hostage unless you pay for a membership. If you don't pay, you must swipe and swipe until the app """"releases"""" a match from your stockpile that you can't see. Then the cycle repeats. Tinder is exactly the same, so unless you pay for the service, get ready for this nightmare."""
"78563:A Google user,""In Joburg where I live, it really works well. The app is really different in that it encourages communication with tips and prompts. Some really good filters help narrow down to great matches. The roles reversal is also cool feature. Made some real quality matches. I really hope it grows in popularity and more users join, which is probably the only downside. Otherwise the best dating app ( of the 3 I've tried, including Tinder) I've used to date."""
78600:dsp yuvraaj,pathetic & very bad experience with bumble. it is a BUNDLE not BUMBLE. sorry guys I am not impressed with the app. that's why I use such words. Tinder is much better than this. thanks
"78682:Adam Lydick,""I love the idea of making messaging opt-in to help reduce the """"creepy bro factor"""". Unfortunately, Bumble falls short in other ways. (1) Profiles are basically limited to the size of a tweet/SMS. So, it's hard to get a feel for what someone is really interested in or looking for. (2) They've recently added filters, but relationship type isn't very fine grained -- no options for non-monogamy. Basically, they want to be a """"less shady Tinder"""". Good for hookups, I guess."""
"78696:Chris Gunn,""I'm 25, male, white, tall, and above average looking. I've been using dating apps for at least 4 years now intermittently. I've been on several dates from Match, PoF, Tinder, and one from CMB. I haven't been on a single date on Bumble and hardly ever get any matches or responses. I use the exact same pictures and bio description across all apps and spend the same amount of time swiping. The results are highly disappointing compared to several other apps that I've used, even living in a highly populated area. Why? I'm not sure. Maybe Bumble has too many stale accounts, poor matchmaking algorithms, or the fact that women have to reply first (many women are very indecisive and need the man to start the convo). Regardless, this is by far the worst app I've used and I've had success with every other dating app but this one."""
"78748:Princesa S.,""More sophisticated than Tinder, but sometimes still the same outcome."""
78894:dajazman2k,The problem with Bumble is that it's in the hands of the women to make the first move. Women are obviously rubbish at this as they've probably never had to do it before. So either they say nothing or just say 'hey'. You get allot more traction on Tinder where it's down to you to open.
"78895:Flo Samus,""Bumble are now pioneering 'Vintage' online dating, in the best possible sense. Thanks, guys, for stepping away from the Tinder nightmare back to something more personal and human. The updated design came first providing a beautiful canvas for the new updates - prompts for what may be important to a potential match, basic stats like height, relationship type... And now you've added filters, so we can finally stop wasting hours of time on profiles which are, from the start, not a match.Thank you!"""
78928:Carol Maldonado,has a similar format to Tinder but is friendlier to the platonic or networking user base
"78947:Carknawt,""Better than Tinder, not as good as Hinge"""
78972:Ray Allen,Bumble is okay. I think they have the best selection in regards to a Tinder or a POF. It used to show you who swiped right on you but now it doesn't and that's kinda lame.
78974:Gonzales D.,Better than Tinder
"79033:Fisher Grubb,""This is more professional than Tinder. Nice touch for women to write first, but a number are just as lazy as guys, so match but forget. I'd prefer this to Tinder, as one has to fill out a few things about themselves, and not be so lazy like Tinder. I think it's important for women to be empowered in dating, as many fit into the stereotype of waiting for the guy to act in stead of being more proactive. Then, us guys don't know what they're into, nice to have more balance😉"""
"79186:Andrew Kish,""- Dozens of matches, no messages (fake profiles?) - Spent a few bucks on their super swipes... Huge waste - Notification spam for *shopping*?! I deleted my profile and uninstalled this spammy scam app. You should too, you'll have success on Tinder, OKC, or PoF because they actually have real users."""
79202:Mike Brandt,Nice dating app. A bit better than Tinder in my experience.
"79206:Matt Bergin Jr,""This app is not entirely a scam but it's damn close. They didn't even show my profile to anyone. I upgraded to the paid option to see who had swiped me and not a single person. I went searching online and found out they have a reputation for blacklisting men's accounts. I tried to demand my money back because I had clearly been scammed and they just said it was against their policy. So they took my money and refused to show my profile to anyone. So yeah, basically a huge scam. And if not, then it's just a terrible app. Tinder is far superior. They don't play games wtih you, they just let you swipe. So don't go on Bumble if you actually want to meet someone. You're wasting your time. Also, to anyone who might think this is just sour grapes from me not getting any dates or matches: I uploaded the same profile more or less to tinder and ok cupid and had over 10 likes within 24 hours and had a date within 7 days. So Bumble wasted a month of my time stringing me along while I could've been on Tinder meeting actually people."""
79209:Mitch Wunderlich,Pretty good app overall. Is like a cleaner version of Tinder where girls message first.
"79251:William Irvine,""Ehh. This has the same problem with gamification of dating rather than sincere pursuits that all swipe/match apps do. I love the concept, but it goes against our cultural norms, which makes actual conversations unlikely. It does have mostly educated women in my area, which is a big plus. It's like a middle to upper middle income version of Tinder. I honestly would rathernot need to swipe and let women message me when they want to talk."""
79254:Mauricio Starosta,Nice dating app. Not as many scams as on Tinder...
"79316:Ian Thompson,""After using Tinder for a while, I think I like Bumble more. I never know what to say to women so I'm glad they have to say something first giving me something to go off of. And it makes me feel like they actually want to connect rather than tally up matches."""
"79362:Esmerelda Merianaldes,""Tinder wouldn't provide the police accurate information after (thankfully only) uncomfortable close calls. All the filters in Bumble make me feel that I won't have such issues. On top of that, I can find platonic, romantivand business contacts"""
"79385:Casey d,""I moved to Bumble from Tinder because I was looking for a more chick-friendly dating app. I tried uploading a picture of me in a one piece bathing suit inside my hotel room, but it was flagged because you can't have indoor swimwear pictures. Ok fine. So what about the COUNTLESS shirtless man pictures I have to scroll through? Bumble also has a """"no shirtless dude unless you're at the beach"""" rule but apparently it doesn't matter. Maybe one or two pictures slipped through the screening system, but it's seriously countless. Whereas I get immediately flagged for showing one thigh."""
79462:Martin Cosgrave Personal,I get more dates of this than what i do on Tinder.
79511:Mitali Sarkate,Best dating app. Better than Tinder and any other dating app
79536:Dan C,I like this app. Works well. Very similar to Tinder.
79554:Oliver Tripp,Better than Tinder
"79555:A J,""Anxiety inducing. As an introvert that gets anxiety, this definitely isn't the dating app for me, I'm more a fan of Hinge. Bumble has some good features but it's really not that different from Tinder in functionality and the people on there, aside from the fact that you have to speak to someone within 24 hours or your match disappears. I wish I could set my own timer because 24 hours is not long enough (life is busy), and also the ability to stop the constant reminders that time is running out... Basically it's just not right for me"""
79566:Erik Lorenz,Better than Tinder
79575:Sean L,Feminist version of Tinder
"79654:Scott Hanley,""Compared to standard dating apps, like POF, Match or Tinder, Bumble encourages women to take the initiative. This system seems to put both parties at ease, reduces instances of scammers & fake accounts and, well, it just seems to work!"""
"79664:MacKenzie Jonson,""I love this app!! Such a great idea! Tinder but for friends! It's so hard to just make friends when you're an adult, at least for me anyways but this is making me branch out! I love it!"""
"79820:Kelly Harmer,""It tells you basics of someone before you commit to liking (height, has kids, where they live etc) unlike Tinder so gets rid of a lot of dull conversation"""
"79860:Andreea Stres,""I don't know how this app aims to reduce the sexual harassment, but my last 2 dates were complete psychos. Generally, guys are much more mysogyn than on Tinder"""
"79868:Nicolas Picardal,""Thousands of girls who only want Chad, stick to Tinder, this app is pathetic"""
79994:Andria Michaels,Much better than Tinder. The women here are a bit more serious. The message and matching featurrs are pretty cool too
79997:Will Huemiller,Better than Tinder. Haven't tried any modes other than date yet.
"80040:Doug Patterson,""This app can be a bit buggy in getting network connection and receiving messages but overall the concept is good.

80104:Hector Ramos,Basically a version of Tinder that dosen't let you waste your time messaging disinterested people. That does make it better I suppose.
80232:A Google user,Kicks Tinder's ass

80306:Michael Tolhurst,Better than Tinder.
"80341:A Google user,""Feminism gone mad. I've told a woman on the site I'm not interested and she reports me,then Bumble (created by 2 females ex Tinder) block me.

"80439:Sasha McLean,""I really appreciate the newer feature to specify what """"you're looking for"""" & can see what other profiles have selected (e.g. a relationship/something casual), it saves a lot of time wasting and I will continue to use this dating app over Tinder as a result."""
"80502:Matthew Stroud,""At first, hopeful, but in time realized it's equally as ineffective as any other dating app. -- Functionally it's a reskinned Tinder with some cool gimmicks. In my experience Bumble boasts roughly equal results so don't expect this to be the alternative you needed from Tinder if that's the goal of the download."""
80505:Tyler D,The ability to see who you swiped right with would be nice. Overall better than Tinder

"80625:A Google user,""The """"girls text first"""" feature is horrible. Everyone knows woman almost never make first contact, and so you see matches happen and they disappear after the 48 hour extend. Beyond that, this app has very few users compared to Tinder. Every 8 - 10 Tinder matches (that I can actually speak to, with no time limit) to my 1 Bumble match that I can only look at for a day or two before it disappears. This app blows."""
"80648:Phillip Lampé,""Give women the 'power' by letting them start the conversation? Lol wow so creative. What do the women even do with this 'power'?

"80678:Paul Nagy,""Honestly, I've tried a few dating apps in my time and so far this one has been the most successful. The premium features are helpful just not worth the price, I don't think. I really like the idea of putting the ball in the women's court and letting them initiate conversations, that's definitely a unique feature and so far I've had the most interactions on this app as opposed to others like POF, OKCupid, or Tinder. Is it perfect? No. Is it preferable? Absolutely."""
"80767:Kevin Eckert,""Basically Tinder but women go first. Loses several stars for the annoying, passive aggressive notifications the app sends about how I should be messaging people I've already messaged"""
"80841:John Furlong,""The concept is fine and the app is pretty good when it works. However, the glitches are just too severe to be worth it. I have to restart the app every 3 swipes because it freezes on the loading screen otherwise. Periodically I've lost the ability to edit my bio at all for days at a time when the option just vanished from settings for literally no reason! The app also constantly crashes and is just generally a mess. If the developers fixed the bugs it would be 5 stars, but they've had 5 years and it somehow has only gotten worse. Use Tinder instead, at least the app works."""

80897:Chase Walling,Way better than Tinder. Introduced me to someone really awesome.
80914:Artur,Just like Tinder. People are mostly on here to see how many matches they are getting. Just an ego game. not a dating app
"81066:Will Thomas,""It speaks as if its a big platform used daily, but you really will be matched with like a person a day while it shows you have about 5 waiting lol. It purposely wastes your time to increase its app ranking with the illusion of possibly receiving sex, love, business, friendship, etc. Almost predatory for the lonely. It made me go back to Tinder. Edit: i always leave my mile search on 100, if by widening criteria you mean adding men to thebperspectuve im ok on that lol"""
81195:A Google user,Tinder is better
81266:Charles Barton-Cooper,Totally awesome app! I had Tinder before this and it kills Tinder! I had Tinder gold 6 months and not one date! First 24 hours on Bumble and I got myself a date.
"81285:A.,""The free side of it used to be good. Now you have to swipe hundreds and hundreds of profile before reaching the ones that have swiped you right comes up unless you pay. Being able to restrict to one year of age would be good: for example, 36 to 36 and also really restricting to one gender. The transgender community is already suffering a lot being antagonised. Having them show up in the feed of men only into women isn't great. These men might just laugh at their profile. To answer the developer comment below: I receive notifications telling me """"This bee likes you! Swipe now to see if it's a match"""". On this notification I can see the face of the person. I tap on it, it opens Bumble and it takes me to swipe tons of people before I finally reach that profile. So far all profiles before the one who swiped yes on me are NOT a match --> conclusion: this proves that people who swiped yes on me are NOT put at the top of my queue (unless I pay an extra for that). I talked with a few of my friends that are transsexuals and transgenders (these terms are different). Instead of being paraded like """"circus freaks"""" in front of sometimes not """"very open-minded"""" (sarcastic tone here) straight males (who selected women and not transsexuals or transgender), they would at least like to have the CHOICE to swipe only men that are interested in them. I'm sure some men would like to pick only """"women"""" as a choice as well. I understand that adding more options is a COST FOR YOU and allowing multiple choices is another one BUT please do not tell me that forcing a minority to the lion's den is about inclusivity. This is insulting. At least """"we're working on it"""" is a more appropriate lie. On that note, let's say I'm 35 and I'd like to see profile of 33 years old as well but only the profile of the 33 years old who at least selected """"up to 35"""" in their preferences in men. I don't care to swipe countless profiles of 33 years old who don't have their preference going up to my age as I won't even appear in their queue. I'm aware that like Tinder you might be against that since most of your money is made on creepy old men sending gifts/charms/other paid extras to 21 years old... Do I need to even comment on how wrong that is and how close that is to woman exploitation and prostitution?"""
81324:matt beram,SCAM. The profiles are fake. They only want you to purchase coins. Tons of tech glitches and frequently crashea. Total waste of time. Tinder and POF are way better.
81374:Alexander Mundy,Seems less toxic than Tinder

"81409:M Grohl,""Way better than other dating apps. There is real people here, not just fake profiles as in Tinder. The app itself is smooth, well polished and easy to use. I just hope they keep it like this for long."""
"81414:Ernest Crvich,""Thanks to the dev team for pointing out the new(ish?) granular notification options, hopefully that will help with the annoying """"rush hour!"""" junk. I would still say that alerting me to people outside my search radius who have swiped right on me is rather pointless, since I won't see them if I open the app. The new profile scrolling is worse than the original, IMHO (you can't scroll anymore in full size pic view). Still better than Tinder though."""
"81425:Jonny O'Connor,""Updated score from 1 to 3 as below problem was fixed. I will mark higher once I can set my location to a fixed place rather than it be roaming.

I really want to give this app better marks but.....I am unable to join Bumble Boost. I want to give these guys more money but the link on the app won't let me. As such, I have 50+ likes that are hidden behind a pay wall that I can't get through, despite trying. Change this and I will be happy to mark higher."""
"81434:Tom McDonnell,""In my short time using Bumble I've found this app to be much better than Tinder or OkCupid. I think the requirement that women message first is an effective way to combat the shotgun approach that many men use on dating apps. On Bumble I don't have to compete with guys that spam every woman with hastily written approaches, and women don't have to sift through piles and piles of such messages, looking for someone genuine. The Bumble method means less work and more success for me."""
"81460:John Whalen,""Images may or may not populate for users, many of which seem to be phantoms- in app purchases never seem to populate, until you prompt their customer service portal, who act as though you should just be stoked to be here.

Mostly worthless time passing if you stay in one place"""
81478:Anthony Pacello,Better than Tinder

"81492:Laura Curtis,""I love the concept and generally find the guys are """"nicer"""" on here than Tinder, both better looking and polite. However, some features of the app make it frustrating. The location at the bottom is annoying. Then if you pay a subscription you get to see who has liked you but you have to click on each individual one and match them. With Tinder it's easier where all your likes are in one place and can swipe on many. It also gives you people from waaaay outside your mile limit. It gave me people 22 miles away when my limit is 8! So the lack of ease of use knocked it down two stars (especially when it's so expensive to pay for)"""
"81575:Theo,""Of all the apps I use, this one gives me the least amount of matches. Not sure why, but bumble does seem a tad bit more buggy at this point then Tinder.

"81624:A Google user,""Whenever I open the application on my phone, I receive a pop up saying that I need to upload an image when I have already uploaded six. I've tried deleting/recreating my account and uninstalling/reinstalling the app with zero luck. Tinder app works just fine on my phone."""
"81626:Josh Graham,""While the new app design with scrolling similar to Instagram looks fancy, it's completely impractical for this type of app. Also you can't even read the bios now due to their horrible background color + font size & color choice.

Wish they'd get their UI act in gear"""
81755:Ben willoughby,Not very many people in my area use this app. Tinder is a much better app imo because of this.
"81829:Simon Nash,""Met a crazy psychopath, a hottie I liked and a girl much fatter than her photo. It's quite good and free. Hotties under 30 seem to match less than sexy cougars - they seem to just use it to get Instagram followers (or perish the thought they don't find me attractive lol) Better than Tinder as there are more women on there."""
81832:Julie Sheppard,Like that you get a little picture of someone who has liked you . Don't like the fake profiles but dont think that can be resolved & it is better than it is on Tinder
81853:RL Furse,women are stuck up compared to hotties on Tinder and Hi5
81965:Gaia Anjali RC,Better quality than Tinder
81966:PASH PASH,Better than Tinder
82061:A Google user,Great concept...but again...freemium just sucks...better experience on CMB and even Tinder than bumble
"82111:Satya Morarji,""A bit scammy. Tells me I've currently got 9 matches and I have to pay premium to 'jump the queue' and see who they are. However, there's no one left to swipe in my area so either they are withholding matches until I pay, in which case there is no queue and they're lying... Or there are no matches in the first place and they are just lying to me to get me to go premium. I don't trust it and get way better matches from Tinder. UI is also laggy"""
"82113:LeeVon White,""Better than the others. The primary reason is simply that women are required, and only women may make the first move in making contact. That simple rule is HUGE! No gross, unwelcomed, random contact from an unmanageable thousands of guys for even moderately attractive women. That fact alone should make it even more popular than tinder which provides only about half as much comfort in introduction. Women only get contacted by guys they have already decided might be a prospect for whom the feeling is also mutual as the men of course only have 24 hours to express that interest to keep them from being """"possibility collectors"""". The concept is perfect. The execution leaves a bit to be desired though. I grant great leeway for the app's occasional bugi-ness. Bumble's main downside is the Tinder-esque lack of ability to refresh through the stack of those profiles potentially missed the first time you swept past them. Getting a small handful of like 2 to 5 new profiles to see per day after maxing out on the profiles one is allowed to see in their que (even for full paying members) is much worse than Tinder which makes it feel pretty useless after the initial encouragement one feels in the successful first couple of weeks when your profile is still in circulation. Given so many nefarious ploys used by software firms these days, I am left with the distinct suspicion that the initial success a user feels with Bumble followed by the sudden, inexplicable vanishing of about 95% of the profiles to review and 100% of connection frequency/interest is likely not an isolated experience for me. Rather, it is the result of a sophisticated formula designed to extract revenue in the duplicitous tradition of modern American business and advertising - especially in the tech industry. As potentially underhanded as they might be, however, Bumble is still the best option out there. Someday, if a dating app comes along that is able to find a clever way to reduce the problems of """"ghosting"""", """"catfishing"""" and also has an even marginally effective way to cupid together good compatible connections instead of disingenuously claiming that their 'computers' magically match potential couples, those developers will surely take over the world."""
82115:Jordan Sloan,Better than Tinder.
82163:Morgan Kralle,UPDATE: layout is better now than before but Android users don't get the profile badges which makes their profiles massively lacking. Quality of matches is about the same as Tinder. I prefer those with verified profiles but the majority of people don't talk or are only looking for hookups
82220:Ryan Karg,Better than Tinder
"82226:A Google user,""The ladies (and guys) on Bumble are typically higher quality, usually established and have a career than on Tinder; let's keep it that way."""
"82269:Martin Taylor,""The UI is just so much garbage. It also doesn't help that I start hearing people talk about the new updates in my friend group and we compare and I'm somehow running an older version even after reinstalling. Not at all intuitive to use. Not conducive to forming lasting connections. And honestly most women just say """"hey"""" so it's not like making women make the first move has actually improved the quality of the interaction. Probably fine for hookups but at that point Tinder has exponentially more users."""
"82282:Jonathan Rodriguez,""Excellent app! I'm a male, and I've tried other dating apps, but this one has given me the most success. Lots of very decent women here. I would recommend this app to any guy who is looking for a serious relationship. If you just want to smash, get Tinder. That app is better for that purpose. If that's not your style, get this."""
82348:David Ellison,More matches than Tinder.
82375:Dale Nattrass,I'm not so sure about the look of the updated app but the concept and quality of this app in terms if the service it provides is fantastic (& much better than Tinder!!!)
"82523:Optometrist,""It's just like Tinder with the swiping, but ladies make the first move by sending the first communication. I hate it, actually, cause even when you send a message, men just leave you unanswered. There needs to be a fiction that makes a message disappear after 24 hours like, you snooze, you lose, but it does what it's meant to do."""
82566:David J. Stevens,The boring version of Tinder.
"82642:Graeme Mole,""Good concept, bad execution. Matches disappear yet I get notifications about them. Potential matches, who I haven't matched with also disappear, since users can't remove their swipes its either fake accounts or Bumble is hiding them. Have potential matches waiting but run out of profiles to swipe. Everything this app does seems to push users towards paying. I've no issue paying if the app is worth it but I won't fund money hungry app developers who can't ever get the basics right. This app is nothing but a poor imitation of Tinder. Will be deleting."""
82649:A Google user,It's just a copy paste of Tinder
82654:Rich,Tinder is way better it's free this app you have to pay to see who has liked you etc it's a waste of time!
82668:Nick Desaulniers,Great concept bad results. I've been using this app for a couple of months and I've had over 10 matches. To where the girls don't even message me. I've had better luck on Tinder and Okcupid.
"82734:Duke,""Not bad, pretty much Tinder with a couple other features (and less """"gimme money to make the app work""""). Some functional issues, like message alerts not working when app is closed, or swiped profiles coming back to the cue immediately. Really like the concept of leaving it to women to initiate conversation; probably cuts down on a lot of unsolicited gross stuff for them, yeah?"""
"82737:A Google user,""Given that 95% of the profiles are fake, are escorts, or are Instagram attention seekers, this app is clearly a complete waste of time. It's even worse than Tinder!"""
82768:YKV YKV,Better than Tinder.
"82826:Alex Kish,""This app definitely does what it says it does the job. It's not quite as fast or as aggressive as Tinder, (from a guy's perspective). Son comparing this app in relations to Tinder which I gave 5 stars. The one thing I like about the app over Tender Is the messaging system allows you to send pics and see if the other person has read your message, allowing for more organic pictures and conversation."""
"82878:A Google user,""Like Tinder but people actually talk on it! Little bit buggy, notifications dont always come through and my match queue has been showing errors for some time. Overall great though."""
82971:A Google user,Better than Tinder!

"83009:Swarup Sahoo,""Works way better than Tinder. The only thing I didn't like is the lack of a feature that exists in the iOS version, where you can tap the phone number and it saves it in your contacts with a picture of the person and a bee emoji with the name. Please add this feature on Android too."""
"83016:Luke,""Much better than Tinder. Meet more women consistently, as they're responsible for contacting YOU. Much slower swiping through people though. Not sure why they coded the swiping to be so much slower than Tinder. It's annoying. Overall I'm happy with Bumble."""
"83073:David Moyer,""It is a """"swipe right for cuties"""" app. Similar to hot or not and tinder. Except here if you both swipe right it is a match, and girls have to decide within 24 hours if they want to send the first message. Clientele here is a bit more classy and """"normal"""" than most of Tinder, better for seeking dates rather than hookups, but as with any dating app you will still find about 30% of the ladies are bots seeking targets for spam and scams. Probably similar for the guys."""
"83128:Nikki Chartier,""Maybe it's a regional issue, but even with 100 miles set, matches are limited and only about 5% even reply when messaged. I came to Bumble because people said it was more serious/better quality than Tinder but I disagree completely. Also bought a 1 week subscription only to find that 90% of those matches were 200+ miles away. Highly disappointed. I'll always recommend Tinder over Bumble."""
83241:Ray Mangione,Blows Tinder away. Women are more invested in the men they've swiped right knowing they're the ones to initiate. Less ghosting.

"83324:PWM,""I have had a great experience on Bumble compared to Tinder. The women on here are more likely to meet you upon matching after they send the first message. Far better then Tinder endless text conversations. Met a fantastic woman on here, so far so good!"""
83358:Spense O,There seems to be more classy women on Bumble ...and bots are far more uncommon unlike Tinder (which is INFESTED with bots and fake profiles). There is a verification feature to make sure that you are real... It seems to be working to drastically reduce fake profiles. App used to not work on my Pixel version 7 up to 8.0.0.0. Works as it should on 8.0.0.1. ... *UPDATE 2/5/18 Bumble won't even let me log in after uninstalling it/clearing local data and cache. It tells me 'incorrect email address' when I try to connect through FB. There is no way to change this either. So its stuck and I can't use this app at all
"83382:Rasheed Ahmad,""In the couple of days using the application I have found it to be like Tinder, but to less toxic and more welcoming to people trying to accomplish different task. I mainly use it for the Networking due to life being less about what you know but who you know."""

"83535:Aris,""Used to be great, but now frozen. I have '2 likes' showing, but for 2 weeks straight I've been swiping with absolutely nothing changing. Still the same '2-likes' with no new matches. Apparently these 2-matches are at the end of infinity. Tinder & Hinge are going great though so whatever."""
"83545:C.B,""This app is OK, and its extremely expensive. Considering it doesn't stick to the distance settings. It shows a few people nearby then will start showing people hundreds of km away. Its nice i guess that girls get a chance to make first move, but at the same time the match expires eventually which is krap. A month of this subscription costs nearly double of Tinder Gold. Not much benefit in it for me because , the match expires after a while, and the distance setting doesnt work the way it should . Will continue to use the free version, not worth paying for"""
"83562:Raluca Nechita,""The app uses the same principle as Tinder only that girls need to take initiative and message first. Good idea but not working. Seems nobody is replying, the app is crashing all the time, I can't get any notifications if I get a new message or match unless I open the app itself. All in all seems Tinder is better."""

83590:A Google user,Giros write first so it's a bit better than Tinder
"83610:nicholas lim,""Good concept, ok execution, but results are absolutely terrible. It's like Tinder, but Females go first. Which seems like a good idea, until you realise they will never ever go first. So yea, if you use this app, swipe everyone right. Lower your standards. Lol i know it sounds insulting to say """"standards"""", but it is the point of dating apps right?"""
"83711:David Stiles,""Bumble is like Tinder that uses Instagram. So naturally it is full of the same sort of people as Instagram. Lots of people with very crafted photos, people who value their appearance in ways that most people do not. Bumble's free membership, like most dating apps, removes your ability to communicate or even see who """"matched"""" you. And the membership is very expensive compared to competitors. Positives: Women make the first move. But males can still choose to """"Match."""" Also, it has a professional networking side that seeks to sort of combine Tinder and Instagram and LinkedIn. There is also a Friends mode. Conclusion: Mostly, a waste of time, unless you are the type of person who is obsessed with Instagram and you want to date similar people, and you're willing to shell out plenty of cash."""
"83732:Nick Tavares,""Pros: Less spam, more genuine people Cons: You can only swipe within your current location (can't adjust it to another city), match time expiration is short (24 hrs isn't enough time), """"superswipes"""" and boosts aren't free (At least on Tinder """"super likes"""" and boosts reload after awhile) Personal experience: I have had zero success with Bumble. Tinder has been successful at least giving me matches and dates."""
"83739:Zane Elliott,""Definitely better than Tinder, still rather ineffective though. A big change I believe all the dating apps need is a more personalized location setting (ie, I live at X and work at Y, so if I swipe and keep my range ~30mi ish I see people all over and the location range is actually crazy). Should also ONLY show people in our location range looking within the same range. Just some quality of life upgrades and this all will be the best dating app"""
83751:Matt Morrison,Better than Tinder.
"83773:Drake Johnson,""I think that this is a natural progression of online dating. It takes the mechanics of Tinder, alters the incentives and overall improves the experience."""
83792:A Google user,Has a good premise but the girls are even flakier than on Tinder (I actually noticed a difference). Additionally I think they stuff the app woth fake 'generic model' profiles. I wish you luck using it but I never had any.
"83820:Ashley Tomas,""There's no regulating going on, the pitch is that this app is supposed to be a female friendly space but I still get disrespectful messages. Men insulting my appearance then asking for sex. I feel dirty and mistreated after using this app. Tinder had more honest men available :/"""

92191:Nathan Christian,For some reason the women on here are way hotter than Tinder or Plenty of Fish
"92209:A Google user,""Great app. Seems like a better class of women than Tinder, and the women initiating contact was a good idea. I know when we match and I get a message, that she is really interested. I imagine women like that their messages aren't bombarded by douche bags and therefore enjoy this app more. The only change I'd like to see, is more than 24-48 hrs before matches expire."""
92263:Andre Erbele,Bumble is the slowest amd least responsive of all the dating apps. Its expensive and doesnt offer much. Its focused on looks (just like Tinder) and does not allow more than 300 character bio for you to describe yourself in. Its a joke of an app.
92290:A Google user,The app is not loading. Something wrong after signing up via Facebook.  Then no success after retrying. Uninstalled and reinstalled and nothing!!!... Waste of time. Tinder better
"92299:Eddie Marrett,""A fine Tinder clone - but the girl has to chat first, but other pretty similar to Tinder (though less ads so far). But really it's only as good as the numbers of people in your local area."""

"92407:Flannigan Bluffs,""Requires Facebook. I closed my FB account due to security concerns. There are so, so many way to verify that someone is a bot or not that don't included Facebook. It's a shame this is the only option. At least with Tinder you can verify with your phone. Get with the modern times, Bumble."""
"92412:Vick Tikoo,""Bumble has become a scam, bigger than Tinder. Initially you will get a few matches and then suddenly it becomes a desert, of course unless you pay! Early this morning I had over 50 coins, a few of which I used and afternoon, there were no coins. I am convinced these apps are only hooking you in to pay, not to match you! If their algorithms matched you religiously, they wouldn't have a revenue stream."""
"92433:Chris Radomile,""The app and interface itself is fine, but if you want to check out other photos besides the main one, it often takes 4 or 5 seconds for each photo to load, even on a fast WiFi connection (meaning it could take up to a minute to see all the photos). The  first photo always loads quickly and I don't have this problem with Tinder on the same Internet connection, so I'm not sure what the issue would be if not the app itself."""
92435:DrQuantum Bunneh,I have been using this app for about a month and I have yet to get a response. I bet all of these profiles are fake and it is just another Tinder or any other dating service.
"92437:A Google user,""Nicest girls - better than Tinder or Happn. The app itself hangs a bit too often, the only drawback."""
92446:William Stewart,If you do not have Facebook this app is worthless just like Tinder.
92482:Cassidy Mixon,Not that bad... Just feels a little too cluttered and I'm personally not a fan of messaging first..or the time limit. I prefer Tinder.
"92543:ThroughHorizons,""Full of fake profiles, requires Facebook, all-around terrible app. Use something else like Tinder."""
92566:Kevin Walton,I can't get a single match! I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. Used the same profile on Tinder and I don't have any problems matching up. I've been hopelessly swiping right on Bumble for weeks and cant seem to match with anyone.
"92586:David Humphrey,""A fine idea with competently-executed software and a few puzzling design decisions (that tight profile character limit...ouch), but it's functionally identical to Tinder if you're ugly, which makes it no use to me."""
"92628:Jeremy Hutchings,""Firstly it's stuffed full of fake profiles, secondly the CEO who split from Tinder to do this obviously doesn't understand that women rarely make the first - if any - move in dating. Online or not. The concept of """"giving power back to women"""" and eliminating ghosting is laughable as they had it all along, and are the main culprits of ghosting. Sad times we live in ...Tinder is balanced as people there are equal ..... bumble is a joke"""
"92668:Anthony Eccles,""After paying app still doesn't show me the matches, still blurred. Contacted Bumble and the issue still persists and matches expire in 24 hrs..better off with Tinder at least that app is functional."""
92781:Trap-Tech On Fresh-Droid TV,People on this app are more serious about relationships instead of sex and going on dates all the time. I love it. I love that women have to lead. Also I don't like the swipe up and down on pictures though. But everything here beats Tinder by miles. Tinder is just garbage town with horrible quality of users.

"92851:Jan Gerrit Klok,""I actually worked in social media myself and if I wanted to keep perfect matches from ever speaking to each other, I'm not sure how better to execute it. Theoretically it's possible to meet someone special through Bumble but shockingly Tinder does it better. And I'm not talking hook ups, actual relationships.   Women on Bumble seem to swipe right much less often. Or let a rare match just whither away as they expire in 24h. WHY would anyone pay for an app that makes it HARDER to get in touch? Get women to actually be less passive online! That's half of the cause for gender imbalance in dating.   While the idea to let women do the partner shopping is great, there are additional limitations. Why all the extra actions for a guy to get a passive match """"extended""""? Women in online dating act passively enough as they are, do we need more hurdles to jump over before acknowledging a guy online? Women need to in my opinion not only get the initiative, but also learn that shopping for men is like shopping for a dress that needs to suit all occasions. Try a few before you buy."""
"92853:A Google user,""I'll never bother with Tinder again. Bumble seems to have a better class of women, and the idea to have women initiate contact after a match was a great one."""
92862:Jacob Cohen,Better than Tinder
92881:Chad Massaker,This app is far far better than other dating apps like Tinder. Whatever their formula is it works in terms of finding higher caliber women today for the most part. Far less sugar babies on here looking for sugar daddies which is good for me. I don't particularly get into the whole hooker with a different payment arrangement plan.
"92896:Rodney Paa,""The layout is better than Tinder, it's smoother on my brain. Tinder is a headache. Tinder is full of fake accounts that will lead you to a site where you pay. Bumble is all real girls so far."""
"92908:A Google user,""Uninstalling because of frequent political editorial content. I happen not to agree with their politics (for example, they praised the LA Clippers, a racist organization who doesn't want black people to attend games, and most of their politics are misandrist, feminist hypocrisy), but would still disapprove of the spam even if I agree.  Glad they have an option not to show push notifications. They're mostly annoying and useless. But then you don't see notices of new matches and new messages. Have to log in blindly and randomly to see if anything new occurred, a scenario I prefer to seeing the useless stuff.  I much prefer the user demographics on Tinder. Almost all women on Bumble in my area are white, liberal, upper class. Tinder has much better diversity. I almost never see a black or Asian profile on Bumble, nor a white working class one. Tinder and POF reflect the diversity in my area and aren't limited to rich """"professionals"""".  If you like rich white women, OK Cupid (owned by the same superior people as Tinder and POF) has similar demographics to this site.  Photos here seem to use more bandwidth than on Tinder.  Most women expect the man to lead, so the main concept here is limiting to both genders.  Recently Bumble spammed libel about Tinder to my email account.  As to their ban on gun photos, I consider guns a dealbreaker and used to swipe no if a woman had a gun in her photo (because women are exempt from the draft. Typical feminists never seek actual equality). Now the people who dislike gun lunatics cannot weed out undesirable matches.  Some of the same people reappear every few weeks.  Goodbye!"""
92919:Matt Maux,It sucks... literally an exact duplicate of Tinder (which also sucks). Only worse.
"92940:Christopher Tavarez,""I thought at first this app would be awsome but then shortly figured out girls never like to message first. Idk if they know thats how this app works and they are supposed to message first, but literly out of the 30 matches i got within a week or 2 not one messaged me at all. Soo i guess ill just stick to POF and Tinder where a conversation  can actually get done."""
"92958:Barrie Mclelland,""A Tinder like app, but puts the responsibilities of the 1st message onto the lady. The location and distance options are very flawed, and definitely needs to be fixed in the next update."""
92971:Phillip Dudley,The app itself is great and intuitive. However a lot of the women's profiles seem like they were copied out of Tinder or they say that the man must message first. That isn't the point of this app.
92981:Monique Elwell,Bumble is Tinder for people with jobs.
"93014:SumDude,""THIS APP SUCKS!! Good luck getting matched with a decent looking girl, that isn't a bot or online prostitute. Only fatties and uggo's. You would probably be better of with Tinder, or anything else."""
"93065:Kyle Palmer,""Never worked, way more response on Tinder.  The new ban on gun pictures is pretty stupid as well.  I personally take a greater interest in women that hunt or target shoot as it's a common interest.  Seems like an app for a bunch of snowflakes to push their agenda on everyone else."""
"93085:Jake Pryce-Jones,""It's just a copy of Tinder. The only difference is that women have to message first, but the only women who message first are spam accounts."""
93134:Vinnie Paul,Photos take forever to load but it's not my connection. Tinder photos load perfectly and quickly.
"93146:Matthew,""I match pretty well with tinder and other apps alike.  I've had bookoo for months now with little to no matches. I've had a few female friends and I sat down and find eachother and we both swiped right to match but we never did. Very strange to me. Tinder I get matches everyday, Same with hot or not and lovoo. Bookoo for some reason, I've had maybe 5? Seems as if you have to pay to get matches."""
"93161:Cory,""The 24 hours to make a connection is very unrealistic considering the fact that most people sleep for 8 hours and  work another 8 hours so realistically you only get 8 hours to make a connection if it's your day off. Additionally as someone who comes from hunting family, and is looking for someone with the same type of background; the fact that you no longer allow firearms in your profile pictures is ridiculous, but you can have marijuana pictures, almost nude pictures, and catfishers around every corner you might want to figure out the priorities and not your politics. It's not smart to alienate a group of people. Not only did I deactivate my account but about 20 other people I know did as well and have now filtered out to different web sites from FarmersOnly to Tinder. after reviewing your reviews I can see I'm not the only person who feels like this as well."""
93199:Benjamin Peterson,This company banning photos of guns was a terrible move. They have completely lost my support. Tinder doesnt do stupid stuff like this.

"93225:Lucy Ballou,""I work two jobs, I pay for premium. I don't have time to spending on selecting yes or no to every person that liked me. Tinder is so much better on that part, I don't need to click on the profile.   Please make it easier to swipe and to deny as well as like profiles, especially the ones that already liked me.   It's confusing sometimes with the ones that are already matched.  The matches are much better, it just takes too long to get to good matches."""
"93241:Alex Lower,""More fun to swipe through than Tinder and the """"ladies first"""" policy is refreshing."""

"93304:Max Cruz,""The pool of attractive females that are not spam is good. When matched, females almost never make the first interaction and the match is lost. I don't see the point in even matching someone when there is not going to be any initial conversation on the females end. Especially when that is an advertised feature. There needs to be some way to remind ladies that they are losing a match due to their shyness. Tinder might be better if you are actually trying to talk to someone."""
"93320:Rasta Loves,""Deleting my review is not cool """"Ex Tinder developers"""" It's no wonder the cost is atrocious and the swipe option is ridiculous. Even users in the app mention this. You really need to modify the cost. Notice your rating is falling apart. As an app developer myself. One should consider a 3 day trail, just to show the benefits of even using Bumble. Yes! it's Fumble, why is that terrible? It's the Truth, and we have the right to know and acknowledge what we're paying for. Would you purchase a house without doors? How can you see how it looks on the inside. Looking through the window is not shopping unless a purchase is made. Samething with everything else in the world. Thank you."""
93323:L. Fletcher,App very laggy and matches just dissappear. Stick to Tinder!
93367:A Google user,Not worth dealing with the self important virtue signaling. Having a platform to make political statements is more important to them than maintaining a working app. Just download Tinder or Hinge.
"93368:Bobby Abrams,""Bumble decided to get political and ban photos of people with guns, bad move, bad for business, will hurt the app. Bumble should worry about Tinder being better not about politics"""
93407:Trevor Stempky,Apparently it only takes a picture of a gun to trigger the Bumble creators. Just use Tinder instead.
"93423:Zack,""It's an okay dating app, I think it's only strong point was its UI. Recently they took a stance against lawful gun owners, making them out to sound like criminals. Will not be using again, POF and Tinder are better anyway."""
"93427:Alec,""Don't download if you're busy. Don't download if you're a man  This app is anti free speech and expression, banning people from having pictures of themselves with weapons, for example in a shooting range, doing what they find enjoyable and fun regardless of political affiliation is prohibition of freedom of expression and speech.  When you get a match, it's on a timer, and if you're busy then oh well you'll have to pay to get them back.  This app also doesn't allow the male to send a message to a female.  This is dumb, but probably the only reason it was made so you can't really fault it for that, but regardless it is stupid because most of the time men are expected to message first.  This was made by an ex Tinder employee and is like a sort of less corrupt but not really Tinder except now it's even worse.  Don't download this garbage."""
93474:Jay Lesley,It's different the problem is making a genuine connection. Surprisingly I think Tinder worked better. Refreshing dating app for the most part!
93600:Kuolettava !,Keeps freezing up and runs incredibly slow.  Imagine Tinder if it ran slow for some reason and half the profiles were abandoned or fake.
"93654:David R. Cole II,""Really great app.. Love the limitless potential. Only wish there was a way to grab a coin or two without actually paying for it somehow.. Either way, i recommend this over Tinder right now."""
"93655:Jesse Townsend,""Great in theory but a failure in execution. Most boring selection of people I've ever seen. Most of them don't even write in their bios. Might as well stick with Tinder because this just basically a lesser version of it, regardless what it advertises. Also, it doesn't save my distance or age settings so I'm getting people from age ranges I don't want who live way too far."""
93672:James Gore,Better than Tinder although less of a user base
93727:Derick torre,Very clever app......friends part is weak.....but I gotta say good quality women and better looking then the ones you find in Tinder. Either way Ive experienced lots of great times with women because of this app so great job Bumble
93733:Jesse James,Classier version of Tinder
93734:Ethan Conrad,Have used both this and Tinder. On Tinder after 5 months or so I'm just shy of 300 matches. In the same time I'm on 0 still on Bumble. I haven't got a single match. Really don't understand as I use the same pics and everything. Would never recommend this to anyone
93767:Andrew Nutbourne,Almost all hook ups. Basically it's Tinder: nothing unique about it.
93773:Philip Pettet,The idea of the is good ive 3 months with the booster wasted money on coins. The time in the booster no matches(I used it regularly)..super likes didnt get any matches. And most of the girls are fake supermodels.. there is not opportunity for your average Joe. When you finally get a match they dont message you. My three months using i got 2 matches 0 messages and 0 dates. Tinder isn't much better but at least I get matches with real people and get dates.
93811:Marcus Beard,Better than Tinder!
93906:Savio Pereira,It's got all the Tinder girls
93907:Bede Wolfenden,Like the app. People swem to be more responsive. Wish it could load peoples photos quicker. Tinder manages loading in a split second where bumble seems to struggle. Maybe use lower res photos?
93924:Austen Paxton,Way better than Tinder. They dont have nearly as many fake profiles
93936:Travis Anderson,More classy than Tinder. Too bad when you match the girl has to message you first. I've lost matches because they don't message first. There's also plenty of fake profiles. Inactive profiles should be disabled or removed from public view after a certain amount of time so our time isn't wasted swiping people not looking for a relationship.
94089:helio carbone,No body matched me back and when they do no body text you but so far it seems much genuine and real than Tinder
"94152:Invin,""It shows you a huge number of fake impossibly good profiles and then suddenly you get the real ones, which are terrible. I've had far better luck with Tinder."""
94332:Kalli Francis,Ok so I never post reviews but this is an amazing app. Very intelligently designed. This is a smart app. I've used Tinder but this is my new favorite. Well worth the money (which I never thought I'd actually say)
"94333:Darren Bolognese,""They told me I had matched but I had to pay to see them, once I did they all suddenly disappeared, just get Tinder."""

"94545:A Google user,""Of all the dating apps, I dislike Bumble and Coffee Meets Bagel the most. Bumble very much feels superficial: like guys are on it just to see how many matches they can get but aren't interested in talking with or actually meeting someone. Guys sometimes unmatch with you immediately, and I found even when I swiped on weekends it didn't help with guys responding before the 24 hours were up. I didn't have any interesting or long conversations on here and, to be honest, felt there weren't that many POC users. Even though this app is supposed to be for dating, I've had more success with Tinder. I gave up on Bumble within a month, which says a lot because I'm stubborn. Oh well."""
"94568:Michael Düwel,""Love it, much better than Tinder. Just somehow nicer, maybe more mature people."""
94571:JackJincklesJones Jr.,Is there a reason why I get no matches? Or do the girls on this app have higher standards than Tinder?
"94579:Shane P,""It's basically just a glorified Tinder, the only difference is the female has to make the first move in order to communicate"""
94580:Travis Beausoleil,I like the idea of the app.  How it looks and operates (the UI.)  But I can't stand how glitchy it is.  It's really amateur programming.  Messages sometimes don't show up.  New matches or messages sometimes disappear then reappear after awhile.  Hire a real programmer and it would be a great app that's better than Tinder.
94673:Charles McGlothlin,Really like it actually. More than Tinder. As a guy I feel the woman on here are more intelligent and motivated to put in actual effort into dating.
94678:Chelsea Hilbert,I've tried multiple times to use this app as it seems like a better alternative to Tinder but I don't have a Facebook and I don't plan on getting one. I understand the need for safety but it seems like by doing so they're keeping out a fair amount of people by not allowing some kind of additional setup option. Maybe if they change that I'll try again.

94853:M C,Rubbish. Tinder is better
"94882:Simon Guy,""Not the greatest experience 2nd time around using this app. Tinder seems to be alot more proactive at getting your profile on the screen of prospective active bio matches.

"95115:A Google user,""The absolute worst version of a downgraded Tinder, who's idea was it to give women the power to message first anyway when they do exactly the opposite of that?

I feel sorry for anyone that pays for their crappy services."""
"95117:Sam Johnson,""There are a lot of problems with this app, but chief among them is that it is really only for straight people.

For gay men this is just a bad version of Tinder with far fewer options to choose from."""
"95181:A Google user,""Quality over quantity is how I would describe this app. You'll be getting a lot less matches over an app such as Tinder, but Bumble makes up for it in the quality of the matches. I've had way more quality interactions in Bumble then other apps, as it flips the table on gender roles and puts the ball in the lady's court. I find that because of this, the people you end up matching with are the ones that actually are willing to put forth the effort to connect with you."""
"95208:Jeremy Lavine,""The vast majority of the profiles appear fake: they're uniformly pretty, thin, white girls with airbrushed photos and unrealistic jobs. I suspect the company put these in themselves as filler, rather than some 3rd party spammers as you get on Tinder. Of course their marketing people deny it. Otherwise, the whole concept of the app is flawed. Women do not send more opening messages just because they're the only ones who can do so, and they don't start sending quality messages. This app offers nothing."""

The big thing that makes this app so nice is that the women seem to be a bit higher class than the other apps like Tinder. I don't know how women select which app to use, but this app seems to have a lot of people from Sunny Isles, doctors, lawyers, Etc. Don't get me wrong, there are such people in the other apps as well, but this app seems to lack the people that look like they live in the hood. People on here seem to know what they want, which is nice. I don't get as many responses as I did with Tinder, though.

96178:Eric Lehnen,I find more success with Tinder actually.

96241:Jeffrey Roberts,Two weeks in and I have zero matches.  Something smells fishy.  As a 6 ft 2 good looking guy I should at least have 1 match in a major city.  Signed up for Tinder 3 days ago and I have almost 100 matches....
"96254:Keith Heim,""Don't bother, you can meet twice the people on Tinder."""
"96441:Rudolf Horak,""This is worse than TINDER. You swipe right, nobody ever responds.  One day just to experiment I shipped all my matched and no response, delete this junk and go to Match or Tinder."""
"96462:David Smith,""Like Tinder but with fewer connections.  Women listed were generally more attractive, but who cares if they don't match for whatever reason?  Found matches on all other apps I've used,  so yeah not impressed by this one."""
96494:Krista Mckerrell,Oh so much more classy than Tinder. Thank you Bumble
96518:A Google user,Stick to Tinder. This app algorithm only works sometimes or if you pay a sub. Plenty of fake-ish profiles top of the list too
96528:sean bawwa,Tinder for snobby girls.
96562:Jason,Easy to use. Would live to have desktop version just like Tinder's  latest roll out.
"96680:Bill Whitlock,""Swiping is slower than Tinder.  Also, Bumble really needs to stop letting people link their Instagram accounts. Yeah it's nice being able to see more pics of someone than they put on Bumble, but the trade off makes it not worth it, and here's the tradeoff: I've seen too many females' profiles say something like """"If you want to talk, msg me on IG"""", and then they just decide if they wanna talk to you or not. It totally defeats the purpose of the app. Guessing this is why I've had WAY better response on Tinder than Bumble: I don't use IG."""
96737:Teryn Green,You can only filter women by age and distance. You can't message women yourself. And women are likely never to respond anyway. And other reviewers have said this app is by the same creators as Tinder. Seriously. Don't waste your time guys.
96776:Taylar Price,The guys on here are quite humble for the most part. Much better than guys on Tinder!
"96808:Calum Coburn,""Better than Tinder, hope they catch up to okcupid"""
96885:Mitchell Fricke,It won't show a match until I have an hour left to respond. Now it's not even showing any connections at all it's been 4 weeks and I haven't had one connection. When I first got the app I would get about 6 a day. This app used to be better than Tinder now it's worse and I'm deleting it right now.
96889:Michael Siemon,It's another shallow mainly pictures dating app where there are probably tons of guys and only a few women.  After a few weeks using the app I have yet to have any conversations.  This is the same reason I ultimately ditched Tinder too.
"96969:Morgan Schonfelder,""Tinder for women by women.   Speaking as a guy, the main thing I've gotten from the app is that I should take more / better pictures and update Facebook.   And, like Tinder, no one (literally, in my area) is """"just looking for friends""""."""
96998:Chris Taylor,Even more difficult to get matches than Tinder. 24 hrs isn't enough time.
97024:Felipo Soares,Lacks the data-based AI of Tinder for candidate selection

97051:Alex Omiotek,Women messaging first with the 24h limit is an interesting but efficient alternative to Tinder.
"97072:John Goundry,""Haha this blows Tinder outta the water, the design and UI makes a hell of a lot more sense, the ability to scroll through pictures before swiping is a nice touch.     I would like to see the ability to choose Spotify songs as opposed to getting a preselected mismatch that's not quite right, also the ability to play a select song in app instead of opening Spotify (Like Tinder, ya'know)  Love it"""
97109:Seth Wright,I can get matches on Tinder.. but never on this app.. weird.
97115:Sean McDowell,Less matches than Tinder but at least the matches are real women. Plus no wasting time with women who only collect matches for an ego boost
97143:Makayla Anderson,Due to the fact I've noticed I get barely any matches comparison to Tinder. 24 hours for somebody to respond is too small of a limit. And the upgrade doesn't seem worth it whatsoever.
97262:Seth Siegel,Tinder is a waste if time
"97293:Casi Matheson,""Easy to use. However not many people actually check their accounts regularly so the expirations I feel need to be extended. Life gets in the way. Also I feel that, like, I live in one city but travel to see family in another. Tinder has a swiping from, option, if you don't want to swipe from the location you're in. I think that it would be good for this app to do that too. Because when I travel I don't ever use it because if I match with anyone I will automatically unmatch with them if they are over a certain distance. However there aren't many scam or spam accounts. Not as many people looking for hookups."""
"97294:Aaron Anderson,""I like that not only are none of my potential matches porn bots, but 99% of them are local. Way better than Tinder."""
"97350:Nate B,""// , I think this app exposes some serious flaws in Tinder style dating, but does little to fix them."""

"97427:Joseph Bowman,""Tons of repeat profiles (that I had swiped right or left on the day before), tons of unverified profiles, boring, and just not as good as Tinder. I also don't understand the """"women message first"""" aspect. You can't message on Tinder if you match with someone, so doesn't that take care of unsolicited messages. I am unsubscribing, and uninstalling the app. Don't bother with your copy+pasted corporate message."""

"97453:David Wesby,""Tinder, but sexist."""
"97456:FoesFlyDennis,""The text/comment field should have more space. I've had much more interaction with girls and at least 7 very nice dates in just over 1 month on Tinder. Have gotten only a few connections and 1 or 2 messages on Bumble and zero dates. IMO this is because on Tinder, I can capitalize on a female's initial interest and message her first. This allows opportunity to build more interest with wit, suggestions for fun date activities or deeper dialog than the terse comment field allows. The 24 hour expiration of a connection is too short too. I don't see why it should expire at all. If 1 of the 2 people want to disconnect, let either 1 do it manually, even if a message has been sent. Some girls don't realize they have to message first. They are waiting for the guy to make first move but he can't. Yes, I've read that in their profile comments. They often say, """"I'm shy so message me first"""", or """"I just realized I have to message first"""". Also, it seems many people use this app only for browsing and want to jump straight to Snapchat or Instagram. I don't want accounts on those mediums. There should be a simple way to indicate what social media each user is on so everyone understands what methods of contact are available for someone of interest. For those of us who don't look like Henry Cavil or Chris Hemsworth in pictures, we need opportunity to make other assets known: life accomplishments & goals, maturity, financial & emotional stability, better idea of our romantic & affectionate qualities and other dialog, more appropriate between 2 who have expressed at least some degree of interest. As your system is today, selections are made based 95% on how good users look in pictures. That's why Tinder consistently gets better results... except for Idris Elba ;)"""

97553:Sam Lang,Girls never respond on Tinder? Well they don't say anything here either!

"97959:Ryan 1h3 Lion,Bumble&gt;Tinder It's not even close"
97994:Matt Segawa,I literally have about 10x more matches on Tinder and have been using Bumble the same amount of time. Maybe it's my area but no matches + no convo = boring. Seems like an ego boost app.
98067:Kalani Cooner,It is very nice and easy to use. And not many fake profiles like some of the other places Tinder is horrible with that
"98103:Jared Law,""When a member of the sex in which you're interested actually uploads decent quality photos, clearly showing their face, their body type, and exhibiting aspects of their personality, it can be an extremely useful tool to determine initial attraction for those of us who are visually-motivated.   Obviously I'm referring to us guys.   And as a normal man, nothing is better at determining initial attraction than the sort of photos described above, of a beautiful woman.   Obviously, Bumble has nothing on OkCupid for determining medium- and long-term compatibility, but it's great for initial attraction.   That said, it is definitely better, for those looking for actual relationships and far deeper, than Tinder.  Tinder is for hookups, Bumble is for something more, and if you properly use OkCupid, it can help you find the one.   If Bumble Incorporated all of the questions and matching features of OKCupid, then it would be far and away the best dating app out there!"""

98532:Justin Comino,Fixes a lot of the problems Tinder has. Great app.
"98666:A Google user,""I like it better than Tinder. It's easy to use and has a nice design. The matches expiring after only 24 hours is kind of annoying, and so is the fact that the option to extend the match only pops up when you first match with someone. Then the option disappears even though the match is expiring. Extend the expiration time to 48 hours to give people time to respond, and make the extend button available up until expiration please."""
"98667:A Google user,""One feature that makes it better than Tinder : women are """"forced to respond""""."""

"98731:A Google user,""Love the premise, and the UI is heaps better than other dating apps, I really want to like it. The only issue? No matches.  I get at least 5x as many matches on apps like Tinder, and that's with Bumble set to a much, much wider radius.  Also, is someone able to explain why I'll be told a couple of profiles have liked me, only for it to disappear next time I log on?"""

"98897:Brian surber,""Been on for a few days now, I like the functionality of this app over Tinder but it seems to be just another dating app where the ladies are out for $$ and not actually wanting to date.

"99148:Lauren Pae,""People don't talk on it - used the app in Australia and had loads of conversations. Here in London, people are using it like Tinder and a total game for matches for their ego. It's pretty disappointing."""

Even if you've got a good profile that attracts people on other apps like Tinder, OKC or POF, this app seems to so rarely produce anything fruitful that it feels like a waste of time to be on it.   I think the concept has a lot of potential and the matches I have gotten have been interesting, it's just die exceedingly rare that it feels like unless you get lucky enough to be on the front of people's stacks all the time that it's just a waste to be on this app much."""

"99363:G F,""Bumble. Hmmm. More like Fumble. Totally dropped the ball with this one. Why? Let's make a list:  1. The Women are absolutely pretentious and shallow. If you're not 6ft tall, predominately white, and look like you just got off of Daddy's yacht-- you have no chance. Good luck maintaining your match's spending habits, too. Rarely is conversation ever initiated on behalf of the females. They, too, have next to nothing to say because you don't fit their """"standards"""". They appear to be more concerned about their HEAVILY PHOTOSHOPPED array of faux photo shoots/wannabe model portfolio of them being caught mid-laugh in front of a beautiful landscape, or posing in their newest swimsuit (or lack thereof) on a beach they took a vacation on (1 of 50 they take yearly), or perfectly timed glance at the camera while drinking a glass of wine/alcohol (because their friend is a """"professional photographer"""")  Hey, your ego is showing ;)  3. The matching system tried it's hand at switching up the conventional gender roles--- which is great--- if the women were actually of quality. This results in 0 messages sent and 0 received in 24 hours. Oops, end of your match! Sorry!  4. If you do manage to get a reply- DON'T MESS UP! It may be the only message you send and will seal your fate!  5. $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT SUBSCRIBE.  It's a total scam. No, you will not receive more matches. You'll just be swiped left quicker than the rest. Tinder has much better incentives for their fees (e.g, Undo, Super Like, Travel, UNL swipes).  6. Why can you not undo a right swipe? People make mistakes, and bumble is more concerned about """"not hurting feelings"""", so once you're locked in--- you can't go back. Leads to awkward encounters and more non-conversation.  7. Download Tinder and POF. Maybe OKCupid to check out match-making and view compatibility.   There ya go. 7 Reasons why."""
"99369:Steve,""The creator of the app is an ultra feminist activist who believes women are superior to men, and takes extra steps in enforcing this.

"99456:Francisco Aragón,""24 hours to respond is too short, even with ONE free extension. You oughta give at least THREE like with backtrack, and give people the option to get more extensions per match if they post about bumble to their Facebook walls.  Another thing, a person's profile is mostly just pictures because you give too few characters for a person to write about themselves (Tinder has you beat there)... And don't think about responding with some generic response, telling me that my opinion is appreciated... How about instead of telling me what I would like to hear, you stop wasting both of our precious time, and MAKE THE APP BETTER."""
99513:A Google user,It would be better if you could select two options like man and BBF. The bonus you pay for doesn't work. Zillions of match on Tinder but nothing on this site? It's slow. Don't bother
99606:Kevin Douglas,People take it more seriously than Tinder.
99697:Lisa Datta,Very similar to Tinder except that it forces you to respond to matches or lose them. This is a good thing. Only people who are really interested respond and the rest disappear as they should.

I know of one friend that has been inactive for over a year and I still saw her profile when I installed the app recently. That would seem to mean you're wading through a sea of inactive users, and anyone out there that might like your profile will be doing the same. The latter problem is fixed by a paid service that lets you go to the front of the line for certain people (like Tinder's superlike, but you don't get any freebies), but that doesn't take care of the former problem.   The developers do seem to care and they might fix this issue in the future,  but for right now it's a pretty significant drag on the app."""

It's actually an ingenious move.  However, 6 pictures and a paragraph is keeping it from enjoying much more success than it already has.  I would have given it 5 stars because I actually met someone on here and it seems to be going quite well so far.  But, I did have to take off a star for some shortcomings.

It's a nice idea but a site that relies on women making the first move when women hate making the first move isn't going to work out in the long run. Shame."""
100547:A Google user,You get girls and then Bumble stops all communication between you and the girls that chose you. It's evil and wrong! I recommend using Tinder. It actually works. Fix your broken  system Bumble!
100557:Blue Frog,No way to sign in without facebook.  If I had facebook I'd use Tinder.  Just let us sign in! Why do you need a facebook?
100586:Mahue Wi,Why do you have to sign up with Facebook? I stopped my FB page for a reason and not going back. It may be popular but not everyone has it😑 Tinder use to be like this until they started a log in with your number.
100739:A Google user,UI is leagues better than Tinder. The whole swipe premise for matching is still cancerous and the worst thing to ever happen to internet meeting.
100764:Anthony Edwards,Better than Tinder
100818:BECHIKH NAOUFEL,Same concept of Tinder
"100832:Steven R,""Meh. Feels data heavy. When reception is good but not great, viewing profiles or swiping is slow. Hive loading page with every swipe. Problems you see with flash based sites. With same reception there is no slow down on Tinder or POF. Also the idea or letting women be the first to message is a nice approach but doesn't seem to be one that works. You end up matching with quite a few but seems they didn't get the memo the man can't make the first move. I would suggest allowing men to send 1 message to their match and only 1 to start things off. And if the match does not reply within 48 hours the match is then removed."""
"100867:Rick Tonetta,""Not bad, not great. Better than Tinder."""
"100875:Derek Steinke,""I love the concept and the user base is overall pretty good, but I have some issues:  1. Please stop this heart icon from bouncing on the super swipe.  2. Please know I will literally never purchase one, at least until we get a free one or day like Tinder.  3. The """"Backtrack"""" feature does not work properly on Android. When I use it, it pulls back some random person I've swiped left on instead of giving me back the most recent person I swiped left on. This has been going on for MONTHS. Please fix this.  Outside of this stuff, the app is pretty good."""
100878:Bridget Wyckoff,It's like Tinder but not terrible!!!

100947:Matthew Derr,Nobody talks. Its already becoming like Tinder. Nobody uses it. The whole 24 hours thing is BS.
101042:Virginia Ramey,Better than Tinder. A well kept secret for those looking for more than hookups!
"101119:""Conrad H. Appel, IV"",""The app itself is really well designed and runs a lot better than competitors. The problem is, I'm pretty sure either no one uses it or all the profiles are fake. I don't think I've gotten a single match (who wasn't a friend in real life). I have the same exact profile on Tinder but I actually get some matches on Tinder. I've had this app for a while and I'm not necessarily an unattractive person so it's hard to rate this app highly."""
"101125:Alex A,""I constantly have to restart the app and then it freezes again on the next profile. It's an interesting concept, but still Tinder is much easier to use"""
101144:David Clark,Layout okay. Overall just use Tinder
"101213:Zac Dredge,""Lacks any real substance. I was thinking that an app where women initiate contact would help weed out sleazy guys and allow the rest of us to communicate more freely. Unfortunately this is essentially a Tinder copy with a gimmick added on.  Have found it ineffective, honestly; I think the system is too restrictive with time limits etc."""
"101217:Nathan Vines,""Decent app, definitely fixes some of the issues that i have with Tinder. Have had good chats with a few people over the last couple of days. 4 stars.  Bearing in mind that i like enjoy this app. My favourite thing so far would have to be reading all the reviews from guys complaining about women not chatting to them, and them blaming it on the app. P.S.A for those people: it's probably because you're a misogynistic loser, bad person or just lame. *mic drop*."""
"101220:Kanaya Maryam,""New super tokens are way too expensive. WAY too expensive. I thought they'd do something like Tinder where you get one a day, but $2 for one... That's absurd. Hopefully the devs read this, because I would like to address the abundance of inactive accounts. Could you please add something that shows when someone was last active?  Pretty ok app. Could use more controls. It'd be nice if you could see when someone was last online. I also haven't had much luck at all, could be I'm not doing something right, but I feel like there's a lack of options that would allow me to increase visibility. Also I keep getting women who swipe right on me, but disappear a couple hours later. I like the concept, but I feel like it could be better."""

101327:Sarah Schreiber,Bubble gets hotter chicks than Tinder
101353:JaYaR Truth,Too many profiles seem fake. Heard that the algorithm puts the most popular people first which does not benefit the majority of people.  Very low amount of matches on here where as on Tinder I get almost too many. Love the idea where women message first though.
101393:Jeremy Wagner-Kaiser,The app is ok. It performs well and does more or less what it promises. Its main failing is that it doesn't clearly communicate to many of its users that the rules are different from on Tinder.
101419:Derick Anderson,less spam and easier to use than Tinder
101451:A Google user,Way better than Tinder. Much more professional. Much easier to use. Nicer app.

"101577:April E.,""So far, I like the user interface; it's a lot like Tinder with the swiping and matching system, easy to use. However, I haven't had much luck at all, perhaps because I am a woman seeking other women, so it might just not be as gay-friendly. Or I'm ugly. Maybe both. I am curious about unlocking who has already swipes 'yes' to me but I think that feature is pretty pricey and I don't want to commit to 6 months of that feature if I decide I don't like the app later on."""
"101583:Mark M,""Doesn't bug out, seems a bit more classy than Tinder but also along the sames lines of it. It's decent."""
"101594:Xana Still,""Superswipe should not be a premium feature because its hard to get attention. Theres something wrong with the app, only 1 match so far after a week of swiping, Tinder gives me constant matches.

101602:Jordan Shelton,Finally far better than Tinder!

101679:A Google user,It's a good alternative to Tinder.
101762:Travis Ahrens,Pretty good app. Seems better than Tinder

"101870:Ivan White,""I hardly ever get a match, and whenever I do they never talk to me anyway. All dating apps are the same. It's really depressing.

101940:A Google user,It's like a classier Tinder.
102004:Boerni Jay,The layout is much better than Tinders imo and the pics can be enlarged too which can be useful  that girls message first is an interesting idea.
"102056:Leon Harris,""Interesting concept and better quality pictures than Tinder, although most seem Instagram heavy and unnatural. Very little diversity, as all seem to be cherry-picked white woman, blonde, blue eyes, who have pet pugs, snowboard every year, ride horses and sit in expensive bars with their friends who look exactly the same.  For when I do find a match, it seems Bumbles execution of its core concept needs rethinking. From my experience 7/10 matches on Tinder results in a two way conversation or a date, in contrast to 7/10 matches on Bumble results in either a timeout or they just dont speak. Women for whatever reason still assume/expect a man to initiate chat, it's just how it is, but instead this tries to force a new way on people for no particularly good reason, which I have found doesn't really work anyway. More than once I have been 'rush' messaged by a match to get rid of the timer which ultimately puts the ball back in my court as well, so what's the point! Few women open with anything more than a 'hey' or 'hi' so again, what's the point? I'm sure some women are probably unaware they actually need to initiate conversation, so they just move on due to no response (I'm assuming). Either way it's a poor way to extort money from men in order to extend this timer thing through a paid feature.  I think it would be better to charge men if they want to chat first, this way they get the best of both worlds while filtering out the types of men that send nonsense to matches which appears to be an issue on Tinder (according to the warning profiles I have read)  Wouldn't really recommend simple due to the app providing many matches in equal number to Tinder, while unlike Tinder, few matches result in an actual conversation.  It's like people swipe right for the sake of it."""
102066:Sam Spitzer,Way better than Tinder or any other dating apps.
"102068:Temi Aridegbe,""Poor concept and very well deserving of 1 star. If I could give zero stars, I would do so in a heartbeat.  First, girls almost never message first. I'm sure you guys at Bumble HQ can easily pull up the profiles and read a majority of girls' profiles. They typically go along the lines of """"Message first or we'll never talk"""". Why make an app dedicated to those who don't use it? It's beyond me.  Second, guys and gals alike this app is filled with fakes. You can have 20 matches, but zero messages. You can extend matches for the next year, but receive not one message. You can rematch 50 times, but still have an empty mailbox. My point? Waste of time and money.  Third, I was a fool to consider this app. Tinder is much in itself. But Bumble is by far one of the worst."""
"102094:Jon Owens,""Seems to be packed with beautiful, intelligent women. And easy to get a first date with them. Perhaps these are the top shelf ladies scared off by Tinder?"""
"102095:SMASH MONSTER,""Better than Tinder, no bots either"""
102104:Ryan Murray,So far I really like it. It seems to be better at finding local people than Tinder.
102179:Bryan Pione,Lot more real conversations than Tinder. I really enjoy it!
102214:Rocco Lapaire,Nice to not have to always start conversation.  Swiping interface is smoother than Tinder.
102225:Nate Hadley,Conceptually I appreciate what this app is trying to achieve but it suffers from a number of fundamental issues in execution. I feel like the site wants to be more than a hook up app but all the changes made to change this from Tinder have really only added a minor barrier to discourage creepy dudes from soliciting sex in the first message. Now they have to reply with a creepy message instead. I also dislike the timeline to reply.
"102240:Daniel Baer,""The app is fun and easy to use. Its not sketchy like Tinder. It needs a lot of improvement. When you meet someone and delete the app your profile stays active. There are so many abandoned profiles. A lot of girls swipe right for everyone and when you match, they decide. So if you are guy, expect a lot of matches and no messages. I find it suspicious that 99% of the girls on here are very attractive and well dressed. I feel that half of them are fake. I've met a couple people out of about 1,000 swipes. Its fun, it works, but there are much easier ways to get a date"""
102298:Chris McConnell,Y'all have to add room for longer bios. That's one thing Tinder has on Bumble.
"102367:Nideo Vinja,""A flawed concept, women almost never message first. This app even offers a smaller profile character count than Tinder (also a terrible app), making it even more superficial. Do yourself a favor and try PoF or OkC and just message them first. Works like a charm."""
102375:A Google user,Far better than Tinder but still has the problem of matching but then no one responding to messages. I love the layout too.
102381:Mychelle Dean,Better than Tinder although the back swipe function NEVER works and randomly returns me to someone I purposely swiped left on in the past 24 hours.
102498:A Google user,works well and just stick with it as you get more interest the longer you stay with it.  keep changing your main photo and dont be negative in your description of your self. it isnt Tinder which to me is good.
102509:B Oxenrider,No offense to bumble. I dislike Tinder as well. Dating apps just kind of suck when you're not a very good looking guy.
102629:Ryan Rasor,Seems to work well. I matched way faster then Tinder
"102673:Ali Shannon,""It's astounding, way better than Tinder. I like the setup, it makes dating really simple"""
"102679:Tony Orellana,""It's a great concept and the girls here are on average cuter than Tinder, the only problems are I match with fewer girls, and I do match, they never make the first move."""
102680:Jenny Laine,I get quite a few matches and I always try to send a somewhat witty or clever opening message....1/15 maybe responds. It's exhausting and not working any better than Tinder so far. Disappointed tbh.
102698:Robsley Auguste,New to this....hoping this works. But I really don't want to go on Tinder! 🙏
102789:Josh Patterson,Unlike Tinder a lot more of the user base is more wholesome and looking for something real
102874:Rahul Noronha,Kind of a dumb idea. Its like Wal-Mart Tinder.
102917:Jimmy Johnstone,Tinder is a lot better.
"102937:Matthew Brower,""It was a great premise: Put the shoe on the other foot. Men are now the ones needing to be impressed, and the women have the opening line. It's a lot like going to a bar and having a woman walk up and say, """"What's a guy like you doing in a place like this?""""  Plus, it actually makes it almost impossible for men to say anything weird. Now, women need to confirm their interest before a guy gets to say something weird. It's a nice safeguard, and it helps us guys not mess it up, and it helps women not get catcalled.  But the thing is, women realized pretty quick that they don't like the pressure of starting the conversation. They would just send """"hey"""" and be done. They still want the guys to make the first move. Most still want to be pursued, not to pursue.  Which is why no one uses it anymore.  Now, believe me when I say: Don't trust reviews that say no one uses a dating app. There's a good chance that those reviewers are just salty. But take it from me: I've had a lot of matches on Tinder. Loads. I've had three matches in roughly the same time with Bumble, all of which didn't make it past the first stage of conversation.  So, does that mean the women on Bumble have higher standards? Maybe. It could also mean that only a handful of women actually still use it. Sure, there are a lot of profiles (though I ran out of profiles in my area once or twice), but I don't think that almost any are active, and I think I know why:  They don't like the pressure to impress their query. Funny how that works, lol.  On top of that, the super-liking function from Tinder is not here.  Which is a minor nit-pick, I know, but you need a way to make yourself stick from a crowd. A way to get their attention amongst their stack of likes.  But maybe I'm just unattractive. Although, judging from my past experience from Tinder, I don't think it's as likely of an explanation. I have thus deleted my Bumble account and uninstalled it. I wouldn't get this app, were I you, but it is a very enlightening commentary on what women want."""
102939:Bill Colson,Very nice better than Tinder
102983:James Pier,While other apps like Tinder and OKC have severely downgraded in the quality of people.  Bumble has top models. Really beautiful.
102997:Jason James,It's nice app unlike Tinder you're​ noticed of who likes you or at least given a blur of the person which is good. Con is not many people are active on the app so most matches are wasted at the end.
"103029:Tyson Guy,""The latest version is buggy as hell and despite having a paid account, support is non-existent! Been over a week since I reported matches and conversations disappearing.   Thought that maybe I got un-matched, but then I met one of the ladies on Tinder that showed me her phone with us matched up, her sending me messages and she's not on my list! I get notifications all the time """"reply to so&so to remain matched"""" when we we'd been chatting back and forth all day! The app is just jacked and not worth the time, much less the $$$. 75% of my matches just vanish for no reason!   Yes, used the feedback button. Days later I got an automated form letter reply saying that they will investigate all bug reports.  Reddit and other online forums are full of people reporting the same bug - matches vanish."""

"103344:Rob Feeny,""Far too many fake profiles. I got a few matches, but it's laughable, 9/10 profiles are of very beautiful women, there's no way it's real.

My friends and I all played with it and basically it seems they've scraped the Instagram of a few thousand attractive women and created fake profiles...  I would have to report 2/3 profiles if I tried to report all the fakes. We all sat around laughing about it at a party. No city in the world has that high of a concentration of beautiful people."""
"103347:Seth L,""The matching algorithm is the worst in the dating app game. Tinder with same photos, bio and people using it gets at least 5 matches a day, bumble 0 matches per day.

"103361:A Google user,""Better quality of men than Tinder. How ever, the notifications don't stay in my status bar, so I miss when I match with someone or get their messages. If im looking at my phone and they pop up, I can get it. I think may have lost quite a few connections because of that."""

103638:karl benacci,Tons of fake profiles. It's pretty humorous when 90% of the women on this app are gorgeous yet on Tinder maybe 15% of them are even attractive. Getting a match on Bumble is next to impossible. There's no doubt in my mind most of these profiles are fake. Probably just another app trying to sell the data they collect to advertising and media companies. Don't even bother downloading this garbage waste of time app. So this means I'll have to meet people like a normal person... in real life.
"103641:Xerxes14 k,""Order of profiles is sketchy at best. I noticed as you begin, profiles are mixed with mostly attractive people BUT towards the end the profiles are all of less attractive folks.

When I get a matches on tinder I at least feel there is a possibility to converse with a human OR a bot! Lol At least it's a conversation!  IF I match on Bumble, the possibility of having a conversation is slim!   Tinder has bots BUT it also has an equal/more amount of good-looking people that actually have conversation.   Advice:  Don't emasculate men with this pseudo feminist app. Equality does NOT mean allowing women to control WHEN a conversation starts. It's apparent, with the lack of conversations on your app, that women cannot keep up with their matches and conversations. Give some equal leverage to both men and women."""

Bumble will toss you a fake match every few months to pretend like you have a chance to get you to pay but she won't message you because their bots aren't as good as Tinder bots.

With god knows how many matches, it's hard enough on Tinder or similar dating apps to catch a girl's eye with a witty intro or suave pickup line but when you make it so the women have to message first only the most attractive ever get messaged, leaving us average looking blokes to get sidelined and ignored. Decent concept, terrible implementation. If your goal was to avoid dick-pics and grotesque first messages, allow the guy only one message to start a convo or something and then have the match expire within 24hrs"""

104099:Morgan Ballard-Wheeler,All that needs to be said is that it's better than Tinder.
104127:John Stephanakis,Have had more conversations in the 1-2 weeks on here than in months with Tinder.
104134:97jettatrek,The setup it great! The women are way nicer than on Tinder. But THERE ARE NO AUDIBLE NOTIFICATIONS! Please fix!  HTC M9
104153:FOREVER,Tinder recognizes my FB but not bumble. From what I experienced I can only give 1 star. no customer support.
"104185:A Google user,""Has fewer bugs than Tinder, but so does my garden shed. Unable to filter by active users so like Tinder you'll be wading through countless inactive accounts."""
104207:Carlos Gill,This app is ridiculous I get hundreds of matches on Tinder and none on here. It seems to only want money or the users whites.
104302:Whoislikegod,Notifications are spotty but it's a great alternative to the hook up friendly Tinder. Also the girls messaging first is an amazing feature
104320:Gerard Tria,Totally easy to use and not the online bar that is Tinder. You can meet normal girls
"104340:Kishan Patel,""Haven't encountered any fake profiles, compared to similar apps such as Tinder. The app is running very well. Women respond to men first which is actually a great idea. You can also find friends, which is nice for people who move to a new city. Overall, very satisfied."""
"104367:Maurizio Sperandio,""Good app.  Neat, simple to use, and unlike Tinder you get unlimited swipes.  It could be improved on the notification side, unless you log on regularly nothing tells you that you have a message or a match so they simply disappear once the time expires.  Matches aren't frequent but generally genuine.  I'd definitely recommend, it's free."""
104383:ANDRE TRIPLETT,The women are a lot prettier than on Tinder. I like how if you mistakenly swiped left on someone you can go back.
104389:Matteo Cesarotto,Better than Tinder!
"104444:subzerox2324,""Easy to use, the app doesn't get in the way of doing its own job like Tinder"""
"104493:Becky S,""Men complain women don't message them after connecting, though most men don't bother talking at all or are looking for a hookup. More like Tinder here."""
"104516:TJ Walenski,""Shows 10 super attractive people right at first that you will never match with, then shows 500 people you will swipe left on. Bad matching, way better luck on Tinder"""
104523:Erik Stroman,Better than Tinder?
104529:Ryan,The hot girls aren't real...go on Tinder.
"104534:FlyWhiteGuy,""If you are looking to meet women,  this is the place to do it.  In my opinion much better than tinder,  on ratio of girls I've met up with.  Tinder girls like to tease.  😣"""
104557:Peter Murphy,Waaaaaaay better than Tinder! An app that is design properly :)
"104605:Brian Bucher,""Doesn't show your profile to others after the first few days if you're not paying for it. Tinder, OKC, POF, and CMB are all so much better."""
104651:Val Rie,athe distance aetting does not work. The concept behind the app is flawed. It does have a better user interface than Tinder though.
104728:Jabberwocky1066,I prefer this to Tinder a little frustrating playing a waiting game a better way of matching with someone I think.
104741:Charles Moritz,Much better than Tinder.
"104748:Colin Drayton,""It far better UX than Tinder and a better design esthetic, Tinder's black and red color scheme always makes me feel slightly shady. The only thing I don't like is that if women have to talk first why, when I get a match is there a choice to message. Finally I'm not sure that every woman is ready to take on the responsibility of making the first move, I feel like by the time people are ready to throw out old gender norms the gender distinctions Bumble makes will be meaningless"""
"104769:John Mansfield,""Too many inactive profiles. Tinder deactivates profiles after a certain amount of time so you're always swiping on active people. On bumble, I could be swiping for hours on people who deleted the app two years ago. Fix this maybe I'll use this app more."""
104786:Ebenezer Ndlhovhu,Better than Tinder
"104793:Shanti Pothapragada,""Interface like Tinder but way smoother, faster to see more pics or text without changing modes."""
104811:Amar Paul,Ranks people by attractiveness (which is a bit dishonest) but the interface is better than Tinder's
104976:Ronn Alford,Easy to use and works well... Seems more refined than Tinder
"104977:ian marcinkowski,""Overall a good experience. The lack of any way of standing out such as Tinder Super-likes means that there is little to no reason to be overly interested in any one profile, but maybe that just means this is a purer form of swipe dating app."""
105007:Hogan Le,Better than Tinder. I like the concept of girls being able to msg guys they are interested in
"105011:A Google user,""Better than Tinder (no max likes per 12hrs) and I've had a lot more responses, quality-wise."""
105016:Zairin,Devs are great. Messaged them about fake profiles and they followed up quickly. Honestly a better platform than Tinder. Not as buggy and definitely easier to use. The limited backtracks per day are also nice.
"105027:Matt Moliterno,""Better than Tinder. If you put work into your profile and you are genuine on the app you have a good chance of meeting people you'll get along with. Unfortunately it won't magically fix you if you're an uninteresting person, so there's definitely room for improvement there..."""
105031:Carly Bond,App just updated and now it won't find people. Just keeps loading. Literally same thing happened with Tinder a couple weeks ago so I was glad Bumble worked...not anymore. Now you both suck evenly. Great!
"105078:Sam Primmer,""The photo interface or whatever you call it is bad. It blows up photos way too big... It's no where near as good as Tinder, put it that way."""
"105079:Karl Dettmann,""It's not worth the time and effort. Although the intentions are good, it ends up being polite Tinder, and taking away the ability for the guy to plead his case. Hinging a conversation's beginning on two people is hard enough, but having only the girl initiate conversation causes the likelihood of the conversation to begin to dwindle and fade. There were often the same girls two swipes after I had swiped them, as if to ask if I were sure I chose correctly. Do not download."""
105099:A Google user,It's great. Way more success than Tinder
"105106:Miss Rose,""It's not a great app for an attractive alt girl looking for a relationship in my area; lots of cops & bros. But the app itself is pretty good. I just wish we got longer bios; Tinder gives you 500 characters, Bumble only gives you 300."""
"105109:Craig Cramer,""I really loved the intention of this app to empower women by forcing them to be the initiator, but the culture of women may not be ready. Profiles are too short to give any depth of description. Women do not initiate contact unless a man extends the timer first (which defeats the purpose of the app). Culture of workaholics that aren't capable of having a real relationship. And worst, 90% of women aren't comfortable with saying anything more than hi  Even after I've replied with a conversation started, most women will not continue a conversation after saying hi. Huge disappointment and I'd recommend Tinder, OkCupid, of POF if some is looking for women who are serious about dating."""
"105122:Keaton Kristick,""Met my last girlfriend on Tinder. So, I figured Bumble ought to be worth a Go!"""
105142:Mike McManus,Easy to use. Like it better than Tinder
105145:Brandon Palmer,The app functions well. However it allows women to collect matches and never act upon them. Really no better than Tinder in that regard.
105150:Mark J Marra,I do not have Facebook and therefore I cannot use Bumble or Tinder they both suck
"105249:Cory Rockwell,""Deserves to be rated much higher. I've talked to more women in the last two days since getting bumble (and have a promising date set up for tomorrow) then the last... Well ever, with Tinder. Tried Badoo too but uninstalled it after an hour because the first person I saw was my recent ex's sister and I quickly found out there are privacy issues as you can't truly block anyone. Bumble is simple and effective and the fact that women msg first means pretty much every conversation goes somewhere. Highly recommended for any non-douchebag guy :)"""
"105318:James Curtis,""My feelings have changed since my first review. However, I only bothered to update this review because the trick they use when they bug me about app feedback (send me to email if I rate poorly vs. to the Play store if favorable).  I was a fan of the app initially, but it hasn’t gotten any better.  I don’t know if the big issues are poor design choices or small active user base. Probably both.  Likes: does -enough- different from Tinder et al. to provide a unique experience; doesn’t try to reinvent a simple concept. UI is -good enough-, I prefer it to Tinder when it works how I think they want it to.  Dislikes: match rate slows to a glacial crawl after the first couple weeks (in well-populated city), showing profiles that are looong inactive + many other match queue issues, picture issues (aspect ratio too restrictive/annoying, load slow) + many other misc., compounding factors.  Finally, Bumble Boost is useless. If the common problem for many men using the app is # of matches, then the features provide no benefit. I was interested in trying out the features, but they provided minimal benefit so I passed.  Disappointing app, but I'll use it from time to time to see if it's improved."""
"105361:A Google user,""App is pretty good overall, better than Tinder in my opinion."""
"105372:Trenton B,""And the results are in! Having had experience with swipe dating apps previously, I ventured into a new account with both Tinder and Bumble on the same day in the middle of Sept 2016. To keep things as accurate as possible, I placed my same pictures up in the same order with the same brief description. My findings? 1 Bumble match to every 11 Tinder matches! 1 to 11!!! It wasn't even a contest. The quality of matches was seemingly similar and it was not uncommon to match the same girl on both accounts."""
"105381:GregR R,""Cool app, better than Tinder"""
"105420:Ethan Chan,""I like the concept of the app. my suggestion is purely from a male user experience - I understand and like the fact the girls have to initiate the talking, but in this case, asking a guy to swipe left or right completely a taste of time. How about only let guy to submit a profile, browse and bookmark the female profiles. Only girl can like and initiate the conversation? Just push push the spectrum of the design to the right.. we are OK with that and you can more distinguished yourself from Tinder"""
"105509:A Google user,""Just like Tinder, this app REQUIRES Facebook. I loathe and detest Facebook and refuse to use it. Please let us use an alternative sign in method."""
"105527:Sammy Livingston,""It will say you have a match, then first show you fake profiles with model pictures. And then it will try and slip in your match discreetly but it's so obvious because all of the other pictures it's been showing you. I actually play a game and guess who is my match by switching back and forth until my match goes away.  So in short, better in functionality than say Tinder but it's so full of fake profiles"""
105547:Samuel Gershman,Glad the Tinder crowd hasn't found this yet.
105624:Jonathan Way,It's great that it doesn't have the scam Bots like Tinder but I've been on the site for a month and haven't met any new people
105628:Benny Georgescu,So far so good. Couple matches and a couple bust. A lot better than Tinder
105681:Maclean Newman,Needs more users and also I find that after the first week I have found about 0 quality matches. This is an app where the girl takes the first step and it's great that there is a working app that tops Tinder.
"105703:Matt Mahan,""Bumble solves Tinder's problem of matches where no one talks. Sometimes the app feels under developed, but its as good as anything else on the market."""
105736:Diana Dallin,The quality of guys is so much better on here then Tinder. I've been on here 3 days and I've gotten six dates!
105759:Indrajeet Ghosalkar,Lots of fake profile. I get matched up but women aren't sending messages which doesn't make sense according to bumble's rules. I am using this for few months still didn't got any single message whereas I get lots of replies or matches in other apps like Tinder. Also it's hard to believe so many beautiful girls are living in my area. In other dating apps I can see normal people but in bumble everyone is a model. The app is a waste of time.
"105761:Josi Elizabeth,""People seem like a classier group than Tinder, but I HATE that people disappear within 24 hrs. Also, it's waaay too easy to accidentally delete someone when you're in the message section."""
"105825:T SwiftFanatic1,""The app boasts that it protects girls from evil nasty men. Don't really understand how equality is trashing and treating sexes differently but whatevs. Unfortunately Bumble isn't done reminding you how unwelcome you apparently are if you are male with a combination of annoying changes, structural issues, and the passive aggressive marketing/direction. For example it used to be that while girls made the first move men had some time to think. Its gone now. Ensuring that men had absolutely no balancing advantage so that their status as 2nd class Bumble citizens was clear seems as plausible an explanation as any. Second and this is the fatal flaw many girls sign up and forget the whole purpose expecting men to initiate/continue pursuit. Men get less matches while women users can still expect frustration over no followup , and those rotten men can still send nasty messages after a like. So, its still Tinder with all problems intact but with a couple weird 'antisexist sexist' gimmicks tacked on. But hey, the app will still gladly take your money even if you are male. C'mon, Bumble's disdain for you doesn't go THAT far. Although come to think of it men/suckers are far more likely to pay."""
105925:Christian Méza,These apps have a hard time trying to meet the goal of their appeal. A principle of a service or product is quality. How do you ensure the quality of an interaction is meeting standards. Just a hair above Tinder. Four stars
"105955:William McCluskey,""This app is basically a tinder clone, but with a few twists. I think the twists are smart and work, but why I'm writing this review is because of the app itself. Tinder on Android is terrible. It crashes almost every time I open it. Message notifications never work, and it's location reporting is often way wrong.  I've only used bumble for a few days, but it's clearly a stable build."""
"106005:A Google user,""Used it daily, I at first assumed I had high standards... even ended up swiping right for *every* woman, regardless of their profiles being empty or opposing to what I wanted, just as an experiment... and now I have no idea of who finds this app useful. Sticking to Tinder and OKC."""
106011:A Google user,How do I have 70+ matches on Tinder and a whopping total of maybe 6 matches on bumble? Fix the way your algorithm takes my personal profile info account and I'll fix the rating I've given you. Pretty sure I'm not even being shown to the majority of users at this point.
106090:David Worker,No bots unlike Tinder where there's so make fake profiles
106119:Jasmine S,Better than Tinder
"106141:A Google user,""All straight women need to download this app, much better guys who aren't crazy like the ones on Tinder.  More relationship and honest guys"""
106150:Jean-François Anstead,This solves the problem they get of overloaded inboxes full of creeps plus they get to realize how hard it really is to open up with icebreakers 100s of times a week just to be ignored time after time again. WELCOME TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE EQUATION LADIES. Best dating app out there by far and it was made by the cofounder of Tinder and Badoo so you know it's well made. Not even inundated with ads or the like. Fantastic app! P.S. soo many women in the reviews giving bad reviews because they're being ignored!
"106207:Artful Dodger,""Good UI, functions reasonably well with only minor bugs/inconveniences, and the defining ideas of limited response time and """"women go first"""" are pretty good. Anywhere outside a large city, however, this is a waste of time. I live in a town of 6000 with another 10 000 in the surrounding area and have gotten two matches in a month, consistently running out of people to swipe. Neither match messaged within the 24 hours (I am a male seeking females). Tinder simply has too many users (I've had 30+ matches there and much more messaging) and this app doesn't do enough better to persuade me to keep using it, let alone spend money on it.  If you like those two divergent features (limited response window + women message first) and live in or near a population centre of at least 50k, try it out. Otherwise, Tinder is a better choice."""
"106239:A Google user,""I was hesitant at first, because I didn't want to be the one to reach out. However, after using tender, I realize this app is way better. It allows for larger size photos, it's easier to scroll through and view all pictures and profiles, communication is easy and I like the filters for mileage, age etc. Definitely would recommend. I hated the Tinder app! This is a breath of fresh air."""
"106291:David Spalding,""I'm enjoying this app. It's simple, not too many bells & whistles, and does what it needs to. Minimal notifications: new connection, new message, that's it. The service has a neat twist, women have to send the first message after a match, and they have 24 hrs in which to do it. You can grant an extension once per day. After only a few days use, I've made some interesting connections, and met someone offline with more to come. One weakness, like other apps, it identifies the person with where they are when using the app, so visitors to your city show up as """"local."""" My only complaint is the very limited space for your profile text. You have to be very brief. Closest corollary is Tinder, and I like this better."""
106309:Reymund Bautista,Seems like there are more professionals here compared to Tinder.
106310:Jordan Beer,Way better than Tinder
106322:Jonathan Lourenco,It is similar to Tinder but those small changes make it surprisingly better.
"106324:A Google user,""This app isn't as popular as say Tinder or OkCupid, so if you have a small dating pool to begin with because of your location all this app will do is further shrink it. I have had issues with most of my few matches not showing up in the match page so I couldn't message them, but maybe I was just unmatched. This app doesn't really tell you either way. I also feel like the majority of the accounts are inactive in my area because of the lack of people. It would be better if they showed the last date online."""
"106325:Ching Liang,""I get matches and dates from Tinder, but I've only gotten one match on Bumble since I downloaded it a few months ago. Are users on Bumble even active?"""
"106334:Joel Schnall,""Primary concept is flawed, but I like the vertical swipe through gallery.  Notifications are broken, continuing to send even after unmatching someone.  Like Tinder, which it clones, essentially useless for actually finding a decent date."""
106424:J Chin,This dating app is worst than Tinder at least Tinder is free! What's the use of this app if you can't even talk to your matches.. Bye Bumble!
106426:Walter Fritz,Great app. No spam bots or fake profile crap. I deleted my Tinder account after 2 days using Bumble.
"106485:Android Testerer,""Like Tinder, allows you to like the profiles of others, and should both parties secretly like each other, then the 'match' is revealed and both parties can then message each other freely. Unfortunately, this app has severe limitations that Tinder does not have: Requires Android 4.1 and + (less users means less potential matches). Profiles are limited to 300 characters (500 on Tinder). Only a female can write a male after matching, and both a message from a female AND a reply from the male must occur within a 24 hour period, else the match expires (if a match expires and you want to get it back, then you have to pay). From my experience, this app that 'empowers' women practically encourages the 'match and unmatch' practice that plagued Tinder months ago, meaning that women seem to be not all that serious about dating using this thing, but rather just like the attention from knowing they are receiving 'likes' that they can then let expire with a 'whoops' and a wink."""
"106493:Jeff Ritter,""Bumble is the best swipe dating app out there. It's a lot like Tinder, if Tinder graduated from college and had a successful job."""
106542:Raphael,Its a copy of Tinder without the match... I got 1 match and I couldn't even talk to her.
106552:Robin Senseney,Lots of hot guys lol. The 24 hour window seems a bit tight. Stresses me out a bit. Doesn't seem to slow down my phone like Tinder does.
106560:Kat Thompson,Better quality people than Tinder. It's really selective and I don't get a lot of matches.
106588:Martin Campbell,Not really a lot of people on it. They really need to ramp up their presence in the UK if they want to compete with Tinder
"106631:Caleb Reeve,""The interface is great, better than Tinder. The best looking females, the ones I would think get the most right swipes, seem to be front loaded. And oddly, none of them ever want to match with me. Which must mean I'm not as handsome as my mom said I was. That makes me sad."""
"106648:Aida Medina,""I don't like that doesn't require a good description of the person, is loosing time and turning into Tinder just an other hook up app, could have more potential to turn into a serious app."""
"106674:Assassin Giant,""The only thing I don't like about this app is you can't contact the woman. The app does not have limited """"like"""", so that is better than Tinder, but unlike Tinder, you can't contact first. One nice thing, is that you know they are interested completely bc they messaged you. One thing I found a little irritating is that some women aren't on the app often so when they do notice that we matched the time is either at the wire, or they don't notice at all and the match expires. For this reason u could message"""
106682:Randy Alarcon,This one seems a bit more dull than Tinder. At least with Tinder they have a brief description with info or IG tags.  This app has nothing. Shame cuz theres some nice looking babe's. But no way to contact them.
106715:Andrew Niederdorf,Better than Tinder but that's not saying much. Less known app so less matches. Appears to be more well rounded and attractive people on here.
"106718:Daniel Clark,""Tinder gets plenty of matches, bumble gets 0. All bots and filler profiles. You're put on bottom of popularity unless you pay to """"boost yourself up"""". Lame"""
"106722:Philip Elder,""Love it , I like it better than Tinder"""
106730:Ragena Eakman,I went on this app after being fed up with the losers on Tinder and I couldn't be happier with my choice!
106736:Kolawole Alli,If the app gets more people and more activity it would definitely over take Tinder without much effort. Find a way to bring it into the mainstream and progress will make this even better.
"106737:Sisko Defiant,""I have had no trouble having conversations or mutual likes on other apps, but this one isn't worth the effort if you are a decent straight guy.  You may as well play Meghan Trainor's """"No"""" in the background if you are a guy using this.  All this app does is empower women to be superficial.  At least with Tinder it is an even playing field."""
"106764:Garrett Leeper,""I was pretty skeptical about this app at first, but someone convinced me to try it out.  The first thing I noticed is that the quality of women was noticeably higher than Tinder or POF.  The concept where women have to initiate the conversation is very interesting.  I've seen firsthand how ridiculous and overwhelming a females inbox can be just from tinder, so this kind of helps keep that under control.  I also liked how there is a """"BFF"""" category for those who truly """"aren't looking for hookups"""" lol."""
106767:Jose Hernandez,1 year of the app and I've had 1 match. They never messaged me. I know I'm not a looker but really? I actually had matches on Tinder. Bumble blows.
"106789:Lucas Bodnyk,""I like swiping up to change pictures. This whole """"ladies go first"""" thing though, it doesn't really do much when the first message is, """"hi"""". Also the userbase is rather small. I prefer it over Tinder, but that's not saying much."""
"106837:Kevin Sangiovanni,""You have allowed this site to be taken over by Transgender Men - 90% of all profiles are now TG - Look closely!  This misrepresentation is obnoxious and egregrious, they have ruined this site and taken advantage of a medium in which heterosexual misrepresentation is rampant already -  Its not longer possible to trust ANYTHING on Bumble!  How could you let this happen?  It's happened on Tinder and POF too...TG, what do you think is going to happen??? Shame on you!"""
106841:Sheena M,They guys are much cuter than Tinder.

"106851:Warren Marsh,""Bumble recently fixed some bugs which is great. Although there seems to be quite a few minimally active users. So far about 30% of matches have contacted me, which seems quite high for a liberal athiest in the south ;). Bumble does significantly front-load it's most attractive users mixed with your admiring swipes. I do prefer the interface over Tinder"""
"106910:Isaiah Snell-Feikema,""Better platform than Tinder. More responsive, seems more resilient to failure. Doesn't drain battery life as quickly as Tinder either. As a user, it is pretty much what you'd expect for the design. Girls typical just say """"hey!"""" but the expiration timer seems to help encourage conversation, which is good."""

"107210:Mike Stone,""Similar to Tinder although it's obvious that the first 5 profiles that pop up on the search are always fake profiles of the most beautiful women, then you see the rest of the genuine profiles. The backtrack popup that always comes up if you tilt the phone is also annoying and impossible to get rid of."""

Just go on Tinder and have morals... Don't waste your time."""
"107304:Cody Heisinger,""This Tinder wannabe falls short of a good formula.  You can pay extra money to extend the expiration limit past 24 hours, yet possibly for a message that will never come.

"107411:Ben Parker,""I used to be a fan of Bumble, its approach with girls messaging first was quite appealing and I found it a better alternative to Tinder than any other dating app. However, since the introduction of the paid """"beehive"""" feature I think it's gone massively downhill.

At least if you're going to introduce a pay wall make it still useable and worthwhile for free users... terrible!"""
"107436:Erik Hogue,""I was hoping this would be like Tinder without the Facebook integration. I shouldn't have to have a profile on a separate site to use an app. I get that you want to weed out fake profiles but it isn't hard to just make a spoof profile and use that. I don't want a Facebook, so I guess I can't use or recommend your app."""
107444:Billy Chan,Good app.  But does the Tinder thing where it breaks after swiping for some time.
107447:Amanda Yollin,Probably 99% of people on here are models with fake profiles just to get you to sign up. Nobody ever answers. Literally the worst app ever! Way to try to make it seem like it's better then Tinder by saying women have the control. IT'S NOT! At least Tinder has real people!
107475:neel naik,Most useless app I have ever seen . Tinder rocks
107497:Jason Heiser,Just go with POF or Tinder or even Happn and don't waste your time waiting for connections that never appear.
"107499:Tyler Payne,""Tinder works well, but this app puts profiles in your swipe queue regardless of your location settings. Even if you have it set to 2 miles, you see the most popular profiles in your queue from 40+ miles away. Location does not matter. Popularity does. Uninstalled."""
"107510:jamie paoletta,""This is mostly fake accounts featuring beautiful women, just like what match does, to lure men in. Women do not have this issue. Just stick with Tinder, at least those bots respond!"""
"107559:Michael Browne,""You'll get maybe 1/2-1/3 of the matches that you get with something like Tinder, and almost no messages. Which is really a shame. I WANT to like Bumble, I want it to succeed, but until they do something to encourage women to send the first message (as they must on Bumble) beyond the 24hr time limit, it just won't. My first thought is to limit the number of right swipes women have as a ratio to the number of first messages they send, but I have no suggestion as to what the exact ratio should be."""
"107588:Brent Krohn,""Not enough people are on this, but they should be. Better design than Tinder, and far less of a pain for the ladies."""
107590:Anthony,Tinder is the best
"107613:Justin Lai,""I had a suspicion a while back about this Bumble thing. Most notably compared to Tinder the girls shown are all clearly much more attractive. Then I started seeing some friends on Bumble. Problem was many of them already were in relationships. When I asked some of them they all told me that they were not on Bumble nor have they ever been on Bumble or even downloaded it. It appears, Bumble is just pulling profiles from Facebook regardless of if they're even on the app, seriously diluting the match pool."""
"107626:Peter Viglietta,""Just a slightly snarkier knock-off version of Tinder. The 'ladies first' thing is a decent idea but just ends up putting the burden on the girl. Also they are unfortunately following suit with the boneheaded idea of not just letting you redo your last swipe.. cause ya know people never swipe quickly on this thing or anything. Just another dumb social media trend, will be outta here in no time.. keep it movin"""
"107630:Jacob Bush,""Bumble is a refreshingly new: more personable version of Tinder. Like the atmosphere, and that ladies have to make the first move. Although rating it at 4 stars because my app is bugging out and not matching me with anybody-strangest thing."""
"107673:Brian Falbo,""This is pretty much Tinder, but it gives the women the initiative by only letting them start a conversation. A bit depressing when you get a match and no chat though ;)"""
107727:Tom Hall,Nice interface and has nicer basic features than Tinder but I'm thinking it is stuffed with fake people.  I've liked a lot and never heard from anyone.  I know I'm no 10 but come on.
107730:Megan M,Lots of matches but very few quality conversations. Let alone basic replies to my initial greetings. Seems just like another Tinder masking itself as a relationship app.
107731:Chris Pearcey,So much better than Tinder!
107764:JayCorone,Don't try this app. Paid for the month and it won't  let me through to make my matches. Should be free like Tinder. That app is much better than Bumble.
"107765:Nicole Heasley,""Lots of really attractive guys, but I get very, very few matches. Way less than I get on Tinder. I think it has a higher number of fake accounts."""
"107805:Ben,""As a long time Tinder user there were some things about Bumble that were refreshingly better immediately.  First the vertical swiping flow and portrait orientation on photos.  Also swiping through the app is smooth like butter with two hands.  Second while I haven't paid yet, the Beeline feature seems smart and efficient for finding matches.  One thing that was obvious though was when I first started swiping they had front-loaded many girls who were clearly very attractive which I'm sure wasn't an accident."""
107806:A Google user,Lots of lovely ladies on this app but they never talk when you match and we dont even get a chance to fire off anything... sometimes in an effort to be different these apps fail and Im tired of not actually meeting anyone off this app. Tinder and Happn have delivered multiple times and yet this never has.
"107832:Louie Centanni,""Maybe it's just bad luck, but I get far fewer matches here (than Tinder) and only about 10% initiate. To quote Elaine Benes, """"Is it possible that I'm not as attractive as I think I am?"""" But seriously, a dating app with no dates defeats the purpose. I do much better in person or on OKCupid."""
107904:JamesAaron,Have only made like 2 matches in a month and a half... Once this becomes more popular it should be better than Tinder.
"107905:Tim Sawicki,""I have no problems matching on any other dating app (even Tinder after you sift through the obvious fake profiles), but I have probably matched with 10 people total in my entire 9-10+ months of using this. Also, very obvious that they put the most attractive/swiped people first which is frankly a terrible approach (although I'm sure women love effortlessly avoiding the million cringy neckbeards). Many profiles are suspiciously model hot (likely fake). Not worth the effort. Use literally anything else."""
107912:Tiglath Aggriever,Better than Tinder
107927:Cory Johnson,I liked Bumble better than Tinder previously. Seemed to be higher quality matches and I was getting tons of them along with lots of emails. Then I made the mistake of installing the update. Haven't gotten a single new match in quite awhile and all that's up in my match queue are ones I'd need to pay for. Nah. I'll see if a reinstall fixes it but I doubt it. Probably just go back to Tinder and uninstall Bumble for good if this doesn't fix it.
"107973:leon jones,""The changes are nice and the BFF feature is nice, but compared to sites like okcupid, POF and Tinder this one is very discouraging. Like i said before i love the idea but i get the feeling that ladies will always be looking for something better, or maybe add a filter for those that are just looking to date and those that want something serious."""
"107996:James Husted,""Inactive accounts are not removed from circulation.  The """"most liked"""" accounts are front loaded every time you log in (distance preferences are ignored).  If you swipe right """"too many times"""" your profile is actually flagged and you get put at the bottom of the pile, but the line is arbitrary and there's no way to """"unflag"""" yourself. Extremely disappointed. Just stick with Tinder."""
"108003:Ian M,""A much better interface than Tinder, but the limited bio section kills it. Also a much smaller population. Add to that their new changes to try to get people to pay...and you have a lackluster experience. I'm about done with it."""
"108027:Darren Elliott,""Most people I've talked with are regular, everyday nice people. The type of people it attracts tends to be higher quality than Tinder. Most people I've met have advanced degrees and have their life together."""
108097:Shana Gerendasy,Better than Tinder! More attractive educated people to chose from!
"108128:Nathan Wilkins,""I live in a decent size city, so Bumble stays pretty active. So much better than Tinder. Tinder is full of spam accounts now, and so far I haven't encountered any with Bumble. I've had some great conversations with cool girls. I'm sure eventually it'll be saturated with the trash like Tinder is.. but for now, it's pretty great. One suggestion tho: give the app a refresh button. Sometimes it says I'm out of people when I'm not. I can change the mile radius to something lower and squeeze out a few more ppl."""
"108169:Marco D.,""Been using it for approx. 1 day and already quite a few matches. Great looking women, love the role reversal as far as first contact. Easy to use, free, and unlimited swipes. Already I like it better than Tinder."""
"108177:Anthony K,""Matches are from weeks ago, always says there are no people, even expanding the search criteria and being near big cities. Recently showed """"new"""" matches, BUT WERE FROM WEEKS AGO AND EXPIRED! This app is awful, can't believe I'm saying it but Tinder is better."""

"108195:Deepak Venkateswaran,""I've tried the app 4-5 times over the last few months. Swiped on many profiles and not a single match, even on profiles I've seen on (and matched on Tinder). Completely useless."""
108196:Brett Veary,Cool concept but everyone has deserted it already so it's useless! Looks like Tinder wins this one
108238:Mike Griffin,Better than Tinder
108245:Rebecca Griffin,Seems to be nicer people on here than Tinder which seems just to be for hook-ups
"108301:Matt Braun,""In theory this seems like it would be good. However, the majority of women around the world would never message a man first. Women have the opportunity to message men first on every other app and roughly 1% actually do so an app focusing on narrow margins is just ridiculous. For all those complaining about Tinder, just remember, the girls had to first like all the douchebags before they could get a message from them. This app does have a pretty good interface though"""
"108335:Frank Jakubiec,""Can't figure out the Konami code to get interest, but such is life. Seems like there is actual DNA behind the profiles instead of just 1's and 0's asking you to be a Turing test of sorts like OKC, Tinder."""
"108462:Carolyn S,""Aside from occasionally/rarely having the app mistakenly show me a profile, I swipe it (either way), and then show me the exact same profile (which sometimes ends up meaning I get matched with someone I had swiped left) this is a great app. The pool of people (at least the men) used to be far, far better (""""quality"""" wise) than Tinder, however, since becoming more popular, the pool of people is obviously growing & making it a lot more hit or miss.  C'est la vie."""
"108469:Greg McCoy,""Every message is just """"Hey."""" If a guy said that on Tinder, he wouldn't get a response."""
108476:Alvaro Jimenez,You get more matches in Tinder
"108496:Anthony Raya,""Pretty sure it's a lot of fake profiles. I didn't get a match for the first few weeks (even when I'd do 100% right swipes for an entire day), and when I wrote feedback to the developer that I thought my match notifications might be broken, I quickly got 2 matches that were clearly fake profiles...I've matched with enough bots on Tinder to know how they talk. It's a cool idea, but I think they went the Ashley Madison route and made a bunch of fake profiles and chat bots to rope in the desperate dudes."""
"108525:Esther Klann,""Told me there was noone around, when I tried to look for women. Deleted it rightaway. — update to your reply. Thank you. I know about changing the filter and I had tried that before deleting the app. That didn't help me. But there are plenty of gay/bi women on Tinder and on Her. So these would be the apps I'd recommend for same sex dating. Tinder and Her. Not Bumble. I'm sorry, it's not working for me."""
"108534:Adam Mikulis,""Most of the profiles in this app are blank or extremely generic, but they must be getting right swipes or else I assume Bumble wouldn't be showing them. Please change the algorithm to show less profiles that haven't even been filled out. On the plus-side, the women are generally more attractive than on Tinder."""
"108536:Kimberly Harris,""Good dating app... Any issues I have are with the men and not the app. It's hard to find the right one, and there are still those who get this app confused with Tinder. But I'm glad this app gives me local guys to see if there is a connection!"""
"108552:Jason White,""A lot of women match but don't message but it's better than Tinder. Don't believe people who say it's fake, I've had 400+ matches and 200+ conversations and I'm ugly!"""
108563:Toby James,I get a lot of replies from Tinder and I mean a lot!!!  but with bumblebee very very few people replying back I'm starting to question some of the people that are on this app some do not  look real and I mean by fake pictures  and some accounts don't even look real at all but I have yet to meet anybody but I did speak to a few people.  I kind of see where you're going with idea of  ladies first reply but I think that kind of kill some of the fun. The truth is most girls won't first approach a guy..
"108564:Travis Dencker,""Its a simple app, just swipe, match, and message.  The service is where they are lacking most.  You have to get used to swiping through 20+ fake profiles before you can start seeing real people.  They reset your swipes at least once a month.  People you have already swiped R/L on pop back up throughout the month.  The 200 character about me section is too restrictive.  The one good thing I have found is that the bot count is less than that of Tinder or similar apps.  For men it doesn't have an alternative way of expressing interest beyond swiping or extending a match."""
108569:Jonathan Maybaum,I haven't really used anything else because nothing else impressed me. Grateful to have a good alternative to Tinder!
"108579:Justin Cardoza,""It would be fantastic if it worked in practice. One app-breaking problem is that most women are still afraid to actually make the first move. The other major problem is that the app will almost always delete your new matches within a few minutes. Until that's fixed, there's not much point in using it. I've uninstalled it from my phone because it's basically useless. You're better off with Tinder, folks."""
"108592:Shawntay Ward,""My cousin told me about the app so I joined and found that it is a bootleg version of Tinder. The only difference is that I initiate the conversation. What I found really ridiculous is that on my 1st day of being on the app, there were no more men for me to choose from within 3 hours. I live in Maryland so the radius would also cover DC and Virginia. You can't be serious!"""
108607:r Long,Same profile on Tinder has been very successful
"108616:メサダステｲン,""Faster results than Tinder gave me, though it's dependant on the girls/matching system. Many more girls that caught my interest however."""
"108633:Ginny Tilby,""Better than Tinder, classier guys, easy to use. Thanks Bumble! Already been on a great date with a great man! Wish there were more filtering options."""
108637:Richard Abi-Rached,Requires less time than Tinder& less fakes but needs 48 hour window! App def tailored to the unemployed with time on their hands
"108693:SQH,""I've spent a month on this app trying to understand what makes guys join. I realize that the men who are on this app are the same type of men who never buy you flowers, forget your birthday, and are poor communicators. I have initiated convos with about 80% of my matches and less than 20% respond. The men on here are either extremely arrogant...have 0 self confidence... or just use this as an easier way to ask if youre DTF. I’ve walked away from most convos feeling less empowered then on Tinder."""
108711:Andrew Vanderpool,At least on Tinder I have people and bots trying to scam me out of my credit card number.
108722:Colin Strylowski,Tons better than Tinder
"108744:Olivier Urban,""You guys have something really messed up with this app. At first I loved the interface, it was a nice change from Tinder. However after a few minutes on my galaxy S6, the notification on how to backtrack pops up every 2 seconds. I have to press the back key and quickly make my decision to swipe right or left before that stupid message pops up again. I will be deleting this app and going back to Tinder I guess. Really disappointed."""
"108770:Jeremy Clark,""Much better app than Tinder! Easier to use; with the """"Queen Bees"""" instigating the conversations, this seems to be have better potential to find connections."""
"108790:Chris Jolley,""I was admittedly skeptical upon hearing they shared some staff with Tinder, an app that is astonishingly badly developed. I'm pleased that Bumble devs know what QA is. The wait was hard, but thanks for bringing this to Android! No complaints! EDIT: App runs, but they changed what set them apart from Tinder. Now men have to reply to replies within a day or matches expire. Now I get a ton of """"hi"""" messages, putting the ball back in my court. Back to Tinder!"""
108812:Miranda Stahn,I read about bumble on a news article and was intrigued. I had never really had a good experience with Tinder so I signed up for Bumble just to chat with no expectations of meeting anyone. First thing I saw it attracts a very different male audience than Tinder (yes a few x-over profiles exist) but in general the guys on Bumble seemed more interested in connection above all else. No cheesy pick up lines just alot of good conversation. However the ap is tech flawed doesn't work on wifi and exhausts data.
"108816:Russell Higgins,""Can't put my phone down, it's so much easier and more fluid than Tinder."""
108817:Ranjan Lamichhane,So much better than Tinder
"108818:Zepha Bali,""I am usually on board with ideas like this. Giving more power to women is usually an amazing idea. Unfortunately I think this app has been a bust for me. I have used this app for a couple weeks now and have yet to even obtain a single match. I am curious as to why, considering I tend to get an abundance of matches on OKC and Tinder. For now, I'll give this two stars until something actually happens."""
"108874:Jake Bennett,""The app is great - the 24 hour timer to start chatting really seems to spur on conversations. I've had a few technical issues, but support has been great at getting back to me. There are far fewer users than on Tinder, but doesn't seem to be any spam! (Yet)"""
108898:Gabriel Kay,Really impressed with this app. I really like the concept of women having to make the first move. On top of that the UI for this app is fantastic. Tinder could learn a thing or two from Bumble
"108912:Brian Zas,""Seriously, this app is a waste of time... Stick with Tinder. As much as I like being matched with very attractive successful woman, I don't. I like real people, not professional photos taken of top level executives, CEOS, and high profile woman. I I think in like 200 swipes, I encountered 1 normal down to earth chick."""
108943:Michael Niven,Tinder is better.
108970:Daniella,Tinder 2.0
"108992:Jessica Lau,""The idea of the app is great, just like Tinder but fewer spam accounts. Unfortunately, the app is not up to par. I have gotten matches and immediately gone to the messages section to message them, but in those two seconds the match disappeared, never to be seen again. If I do manage to message them, I've had the time out counter disappear (which seems to usually only happen when they respond), but receive no response message. Messages to support said only that they were aware of the problem."""
"108996:Trey Capnerhurst,""The place where ppl go when Tinder has failed them.  Soooo. ..all the incredibly hot women, who are clearly tired of the abuse, and men who couldn't get a date. The design is improved over Tinder, including reporting, but the men still seem to confuse opening conversation with sexting, fetishizing, and abuse. Deleting this app after only one week. I can get just as disgusting misogyny  on my FB feed, without them thinking they can can try to date me. Nice BBF feature, if there were many ppl using it..."""
"109005:tristan jones,""Tinder I get all kinds of responses. Here, not a single one. This app has all fake ppl. I'm no perfect 10. But I swiped on everyone to see. And nothing. Safe to say I am deleting and never returning. And I hope no one else ever downloads this garbage."""
109009:Jared Williams,Tinder has a lot of spam accounts now. I have not had any issues with spam on bumble yet.  Quality people pursuing happiness for the most part on this ap. Good work!
109019:Zachary Cogan,Easy format and an all-round cleaner feel than Tinder.
109110:Anthony Dupont,Basically a better Tinder. Just needs to be more popular.
109113:Peter Boone,I like this app so far. Seems a little bit better than Tinder.
109159:Arturo Hernandez,I start using Bumble not knowing what I was getting into but I gotta say it's way better than Tinder because there's no Bots I have run into and it's real people
"109187:Joe Hoffman,""Good concept, needs work on swipe sensitivity.  It gets really frustrating on a Note to have to try four or five times to swipe a profile because I didn't manage to go completely across the screen.  Tinder's app is tuned much better."""
"109223:Daniel,""When it worked I went a month without a match or message.  Then it just quit working altogether.  Went back to Tinder and OkCupid and still get the flakey dates and horrible conversations, but at least they work...."""
"109225:music fan,""Just like Tinder, but a smidge nicer."""
"109262:Case G,""An absolutely polished idea. The UI is good, clean and easy on the eyes. Being a male, I'm very well past done having to message EVERY girl I come across just to wait forever and be denied by 90% of them so the fact that women HAVE to initiate conversation before things take off is pure gold. It's what Tinder needed to do but failed to. Easiest 5 star I've ever given."""
"109296:Mike Wallace,""Tinder is full of Bugs, this works perfectly for me. Not a fan of the woman must contact first concept. She already said yes, and many are shy or want the man to go first."""
"109308:Andrew Corsberg,""Since this app, like Tinder, relies upon (mostly) superficial snap judgments, yet also includes a time limit, therefore the individual profiles should be """"recycled"""". Often those snap judgments are fleeting and often influenced by environments and moods. I may """"like"""" someone if exposed to them on Friday, but I may dislike them because I was exposed to that profile on a Monday. Consequently, myself and potential matches may miss out on the opportunity to connect."""
"109373:Bethany Ross,""This app does basically the same thing as every other site. I don't get how the woman starting the conversation makes the guys any more interested than someone on Tinder per say. I thought once I'd tried the app I'd notice a different calabria of men. Not so much. Same dudes differ swip.  Even if I am on bord with the """"I talk first"""" idea, the 24 hr limit is unrealistic for someone with a life. And if you swipe more than one person, match eachother, you have basically a half a day, if that, to come up with several different witty conversation, bc saying 'hi' is un-inventive and unoriginal. My bad, I have minutes to respond bc I was, I dunno, sleeping through halfof my 24 hr allotted time and am just trying to keep the match. Then, after all that, the app messes up. Not notifying me of a message and then when try and respond,my match is available & no box pops up for me to write him back.  There should also be a section that allows you to check if any of the men you've swiped are still contenders. As in, if they pass on you, maybe ge/shedissapearsfrom your possibility section or something in that sense... just a thought. Otherwise, I'm now so over online dating, it's all the same."""
"109388:Lindsay Fowks,""The description of the app does not say that you have to have Facebook but you do, and that's one of the reasons why I'm not on Tinder. I was hoping that Bumble would be different."""
"109398:Vanessa S,""When I get an alert that I have a match, I would say hello right away to start a conversation before 24 hrs is up. And as the day goes by... Zero response. So having the girl make the 'first move' doesn't matter. Might as well go back to using Tinder where the matches don't disappear on you. The rewind feature is great tho."""
"109435:J. H.,""Better than Tinder, still not perfect"""

109548:Cierra Truss,I think the concept is good without the super sketchy-ness of Tinder.
"109567:V M,""Doesn't crash like Tinder always does, is more fun and easier to use, and since women start the conversations I find the quality of conversations ends up being better."""
"109570:Jason Corona,""No matches after weeks, although maybe I missed my chance; they added that 24hr chat expire while I was camping over the weekend, so make sure you never do anything out of cell tower range I guess. I may not be a 10, but I got plenty of matches on Tinder after a few days. This app basically offers nothing but blurry pictures of pretty women and feelings of vague disappointment. If that sounds like the dating experience you're after, this is your app. Or alternately just go watch some free porn."""
109594:Gregory Jean,Différents de Tinder et compagnie
109665:Gabrieljorama,Looks great and has way better navigation than Tinder. That being said: Women now have all the power in their hands to choose. It has not worked for me. Props to those who actually get picked.
"109716:Stive Stivesy,""Nobody uses this app. I've had it a little over a week now. At first I used it like Tinder and swiped selectively as I was under the impression that there were other real users out there. After a week of no matches, I swiped positively for EVERYONE for several minutes until the app literally told me that I was """"out of people."""" The next day I got ONE match who didn't even show up in my pending tab. Maybe I'm not the best looking guy, but at least I  get SOME matches on Tindr. Nothing but dead profiles here."""
"109727:james bentley,""Unlimited swiping of beautiful ladies who are way outta my league. The normal woman are mostly professional, which I like & not covered in tats; so there's hope for regular guys.  The app is easy to use, but has less text characters for the profiles than Tinder.  I prefer the open OkC model; words matter.  Love the send a pic function, it eliminates asking for a phone number, but idiots will misuse it. Hate the limited text area to see and navigate for proofreading.  24hr waits haven't been good to me."""
"109763:Jim Smith,""In reality, each person should be able to initiate a conversation, but then it's just tinder so I've uninstalled and gone back there. I'm not sure how they market to women but it seems that they all are basically the same on here, at least in my age range. Tinder has way more diversity but that could be due to its time on the market."""

109849:Chris Jubinsky,Better then Tinder
109863:A Google user,Much much better than tinder in app quality. Tinder used to fail and close constantly Bumble does not. Also the quality of women just seems much better. Maybe it's this model of women making the first move that's provoking some efficacy?
"109867:Matthew Moore,""The only difference between this and Tinder is that more girls on here have an excessive amount of makeup on. Also you have to physically swipe, which gets to be much when there's an endless onslaught of party clowns.  On another note, what do you do if you don't have a facebook account?"""
"109873:luis vargas,""Although it might provoke people from saying you copied Tinder this apps needs some like and dislike """"buttons"""". The swipe is sometimes really laggy and unstable. Also get some glitches when you swipe and move the picture, and someone else appears after you move the picture. This app would be a lot better if the developers refine the GUI. Thanks."""
109914:Patrick Molina,Been swiping and swiping and swiping. Still no matches. I used the same bio I use on Tinder and still no matches. Uninstalling
"109960:David Harper,""Better than Tinder. Quality of women is good, but I wish it would let you undo a swipe. I've accidentally swiped left or right a couple of times."""
"109969:Matt Gentile,""The app is somewhat odd. I like that it doesn't restrict how many times you can swipe, like Tinder. But all the women on here are gorgeous, like how are they not taken already?? Another issue is that I've swiped right 98% of the time and only 1 match. Now I'm not the best looking guy out there, but I must have gone 300 women on there now and only 1???? Something is off.."""
109987:Ryan Becerra,First fail- tinder had the worst (and I mean worst) cropping tool I had ever seen. Then bumble came along and took the title. How you don't fix that or make it more useful when this apps focal point is for a contact to see a picture(not even a bio)  is beyond me.      2nd- what's the difference? Girls message first? That's it? Create something to stand out. Tinder had moments  then took them away even though people loved them. Do something like that. Otherwise it's just a sad knockoff of tinder
"110023:Chanty,""The app definitely needs some work, half the time you don't receive the notifications. The concept does not work. I'm 25, good looking, yet half of the matches do not respond. I think people who've done the tour on Tinder come on here after, already bored and not looking to meet. I wouldn't waist my time on here"""
110028:Brandon Johnson,Better layout than Tinder
"110034:Roland Cleaver,""Nice idea bumlbling through the tumbleweed and they desperately need seed the app with some girls. Try a PR blitz with Cosmo, Marie Claire or whatever.

"110094:Alan Schoen,""Bumble started out pretty well for me, but then it got really weird.  For the first couple weeks, I matched with women who were very interesting to me.  They were a little more shy and reclusive than the girls I meet on Tinder.  I talked to a few, and I met one who I am still seeing pretty regularly. But at some point, Bumble stopped showing me real women, and started showing me fake-looking profiles.  They look more like ads for erotic services than actual dating profiles.  This has turned me off to the app, and I'm thinking about deleting it now."""
"110188:Scott Bialor,""I do pretty well on Tinder I got stupid jokes for days and a solid profile. And most of the girls on bumble are SPECTACULAR, seriously. But it's been over a month of occasionally going on and swiping with reckless abandon and haven't gotten A SINGLE MATCH. The idea is good and the app runs smoothly but the female users seem to have incredibly unrealistic expectations."""
"110190:Jacob J.,""App is far superior looking than Tinder.  Photos """"pop off"""" the page and the details area is uniquely available with a simple click. I like swiping up to view more photos.   Using the app itself was boooooring. Maybe because of my area or because women in my area don't use it the way Bumble creators had hoped.  Speaking with women at a singles mixer recently, many said they had profiles but used it less often than Tinder. """"Too much work""""   Once a match is formed, if """"she"""" doesn't send a message within 24 hours you have an ability to pay to keep the connection open another 24 hours. Whose to say she will?   I got 2 connections but no conversations after 3 months of usage.  Terrible odds. Back to real life singles events for me."""
110210:Timothy Bjurquist,Just like Tinder but no fake profiles (yet) and the women HAVE to message you first which is kinda cool.
"110257:corey benson,""This ap could be the next Tinder. So far, it's failing. Fix the 'no network connection' amongst other things.."""
110260:Tamarr Purdom,Tinder on steroids lol
"110267:Suzie Parr,""It bothers that I  constantly matched with people just visiting my location.  I am looking for a relationship, not a hook up....if I wanted that I would go to Tinder or POF"""
"110275:Eric Hinz,""1) Accounts are FAKE 2) The remaining legitimate accounts are not used anymore, therefore no response back 3) In the very rare chance a girl messages you after a match, she could just put """"hey"""" and her end of the deal is done with no further communication. 4) I have concluded that the concept is good, but severely flawed. Though it's an ego boosting app like Tinder, at least I would use their app first to actually get some conversation."""
110276:Chris Ochs,Much better than Tinder
"110280:Manny Bee,""At first I was against the whole """"women first"""" thing. Then, I remembered the amount of time spent on Tinder coming up with witty openers only to get a stale reply or no reply at all (after hundreds of matches, this was the main case). This app is great because it cuts out the attention seeking; women are more picky on their matches because they have to start the convo. Sure, that means less matches but it also means less time wasted. Quality of women is also x10 better than Tinder, with less bots too!"""
"110289:Hunter Dennis,""I use both Tinder and Bumble. First, I would like to point out that there has to be fake profiles on here or something. Also there isn't enough people on this app. Although Tinder is more popular, this app lets you do little things that Tinder does not. You can reorder your photos on your profile (something Tinder will not let you do). Another example is that you don't have to click on their card to swipe through their pics. You can simple swipe up and down. Just makes it a lot simpler."""
"110296:D Vialpando,""Great concept but I would say that ladies aren't aggressive enough to have all the control. By far the least amount of activity out of ANY dating app I've used (compared to Tinder, OKC, and POF)."""
"110299:R F,""Dating pool in Australia a bit limited, otherwise this is a great concept and better than Tinder IMHO."""
110302:Lj LaValle,Funny how they front load all the good looking people first each time you surf through all of the profiles. Most profiles look like glamour shots - hard to believe they are legit - only 2 responses in the last week with no follow ups - time waster - Tinder is way better - deleting this crap.
110316:Joshua Silva,Simple and user friendly. Better than Tinder that's for sure.
110323:Tony Villar,Better than Tinder across the board
"110369:Mike Tsho,""So first thing I noticed is this app doesn't run like total garbage whilst also draining my battery. Tinder is the absolute opposite. This app also doesn't FREAK OUT when I put my phone in landscape mode to type. Tinder completely resets the app.  Also, the people on here aren't as trashy"""
"110372:J P,""I guess they all can't be like Tinder, but it's free. Definitely wouldn't pay money for it."""
"110384:Joseph,""Maybe I'm ugly, maybe all the profiles on here are fake. No matches, ever. Makes me miss the Tinderbots."""
"110387:Andrew Raynier,""It's like the good old version of Tinder with unlimited swipes, and no robots so far."""
"110426:Graeme Crawley,""Love the idea behind the app and the app interface itself. However, I feel like it's not as fluent to use as most high quality apps available today. For example:   switching back and forth between conversations and matches can sometimes take about 3-5 seconds.   I know it's not much, but from a user standpoint my immediate thought was """"this is slower than Tinder"""". Love the app though."""
"110430:Cassandra Geneve,""Super easy to use,  the notification system is super great! Way better than Tinder"""
"110461:Josh Dorfman,""Great concept and I agree with the style of matching and and all, but there are multiple complaints of which I agree with. Ive had it for over 2 months and still have not received a single match. I mean I have received one but when I checked there wasn't anybody there on my matches. So far, Tinder and Meet Me are the best options."""
110477:A Google user,Girls are more attractive than Tinder. But no prospect yet :-)
"110546:Bikat Uprety,""The most boring dating app. Maybe I'm just ugly but normally have enough success on Tinder... basically,  it takes ages to match and once you do the girls almost never speak to you so the matches expire. Verdict: boring and waste of time"""
110556:Everett Guenther,You might as well just use Tinder its functionally the same and has so many less fake accounts
110563:Matt Buckley,Good alternative to Tinder.
110570:Andrew G,Much better than Tinder
110574:Smith,Not getting nearly as many matches on here than I get on Tinder maybe that's normal. Seems nice though.
"110575:Axel Escarcega,""Either the swiping function requires a certain flicking technique that I don't possess or it's just messed up. When I try to swipe left or write, the picture either moves a little then snaps back into place, or skips to a random person. I swiped right on people I didn't want to match with, which led to awkward situations. I give it a 3 because I like the premise of giving people a deadline to talk. Tinder is more about stroking your ego with how attractive your matches are than actual conversation."""
"110608:David Brown,""Great concept, and flawless app. Way better than other dating apps! Looking at you Tinder..."""
"110614:Justin Collins,""The functionality is great, performance wise it works more smoothly than Tinder or Hinge on my Note 4, UI is basically identical to Hinge and Tinder so ease of use is familiar and easy. I have had better conversations on here than on other apps and it's nice to know the girl is interested in me first. I find it funny that girls have confessed they feel a bit intimidated trying to think of what to say first. Lol This will potentially help women understand the pressure that is on us men!"""
110640:Sewwandi Madigapola,I like it better than Tinder
"110659:Anastasia Mark,""I find Tinder super glitchy, bumble works great."""
"110697:Michael Glass,""I like this as a Tinder alternative, though there are fewer users on it at the moment. It sucks, I've matched with a decent amount of girls and none of them have replied before their time limit ran out."""
110734:Devin Capps,Made me realize how boring most chicks are. Very few actually try to impress with a solid opener. App is still cool though. Not a bunch of fake profiles like Tinder.
"110737:Amber S,""Only experienced one glitch otherwise app is 100x better than Tinder since they have all the ridiculous updates. Just which guys would use it for dating and not hooking up. Also a lot of men don't respond, which makes the matches list cluttered. Give men 24 hours to respond to our message, just like how we have 24 hours to start a conversation. Also adding a search button on the matched list would be great so we could find who we're looking for without scrolling way down."""
"110766:Ricky Nguyen,""Let's just say all the other dating apps work better. . . Because they do and I've tried them.    Tinder, okc even grinder"""
110771:Annalise Nicholson,App works fine for the most part. But the premise just doesn't work. Dudes don't want girls to make the first move. They lose interest or blow you off. Just made me feel like crap about myself. Tinder might suck but at least people follow through. Months on this app and not one actual date
"110790:Brandon Corbett,""I love the idea of women messaging first. But the android app feels funky. Contrary to some, I don't believe *every* profile is a fake. But it does feel like a few might be planted. I can't say if it's similar to the camgirl bots on Tinder, but it leads me to my next problem: many of my matches are not women I've actually swiped right on. Some are, but I get random matches from girls that I would never consciously swipe right. Maybe they're mistakes, but there's been too many to call it a coincidence."""
"110792:Brent Grablachoff,""Great app. Way cuter talent pool versus Tinder. Got a decent amount of matches and messages. Only problem I've had is consistently the app doesn't work right on 4G LTE, it only works properly on WiFi. And all other apps including Tinder work fine. The matches honeycomb keeps loading and many times photos of the matches don't show up. Strange. Please fix."""
110813:Seita Goto,I love the simplicity of this app. I've always found it weird on Tinder that you have to tap on the photo then swipe left to view the person's photos.  I accidentally swiped left on so many people from trying to see more of their pictures. The up and down swiping is a great solution that is no longer for an option for the other app because of Super Likes. Lot of people here seems to be complaining about back end issues but I don't know if they're true. If it is true hope you guys can sort that out soon.
110820:Larry Henson,Tinder wannabe that fails drastically.
"110840:Tryksta 724,""Yes, the women are significantly more attractive than Tinder and yes, the app requires them to speak first. They still find a way to play games. I rarely match and when I do, it usually expires or in the few convos I've actually had, at some point they stop talking. What good is looking at attractive people if nothing can get off the ground?"""
110934:Trish Dieudonne,Tinder was getting ridiculous. The last straw was when the decided to completely kill the app with that last update removing the moments. Thank goodness bumble is now available for Android. It gives a nice fresh spin on dating apps.
